# NVIDIA Infra Controller

NVIDIA Infra Controller (NICo) delivers zero-touch lifecycle automation for
bare-metal systems that secures datacenter infrastructure at its foundation.

It is an API-based microservice that provides site-local, zero-trust,
bare-metal lifecycle management with DPU-enforced isolation. NICo automates the complexity
of the bare-metal lifecycle to fast-track building next generation AI Cloud offerings.

## Getting Started

- Go to the [NVIDIA Infra Controller overview](docs/overview/what-is-nico.md) to get an overview of NICo architecture and capabilities.
- Or, go straight to the [Quick Start Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/getting-started/quick-start-guide) to start setting up your site for NICo.
- The [NICo web documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/home) is available online.
- Check out [Local Development with DevSpace](dev/deployment/devspace/README.md) to run NICo locally with mock systems.

## Bare-Metal Cluster Setup

`helm-prereqs/setup.sh` deploys the full NVIDIA Infra Controller stack onto a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster in three layers:

| Layer | What it installs | Helm release |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Common services** | MetalLB, cert-manager, Vault, external-secrets, PostgreSQL | via `helmfile` in `helm-prereqs/` |
| **NICo Core** | NVIDIA Infra Controller (this repo's `helm/` chart) | `nico` in `nico-system` |
| **NICo REST** | NVIDIA Infra Controller's REST API, Temporal, Keycloak, site-agent | `nico-rest` + `nico-rest-site-agent` in `nico-rest` |

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster with `KUBECONFIG` set
- `helm`, `helmfile`, `kubectl`, `jq` installed
- Images pushed to your container registry

### Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build and push amd64/arm64 container images from this clone.
#    See docs/manuals/building_nico_containers.md for the build-host prerequisites.
export IMAGE_REGISTRY=my-registry.example.com/infra-controller
make images IMAGE_REGISTRY="${IMAGE_REGISTRY}"   # NICo Core (nico) + REST service images

# 2. Set environment variables
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY="${IMAGE_REGISTRY}"
export NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG=NICO_CORE_TAG             # e.g. 2.0.0-pr-58-g38a54a3f
export NICO_REST_IMAGE_TAG=NICO_REST_TAG             # e.g. 2.0.0-pr-58-g38a54a3f
# export REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET=RAW_API_KEY            # optional; raw key for authenticated registries

# DPF (DOCA Platform Framework) DPU provisioning installs BY DEFAULT.
# Set these three variables, or pass --skip-dpf to opt out:
export NICO_DPF_DPU_INTERFACE=<nic-facing-dpus>     # controller NIC for the DPU cluster VIP
export NICO_DPF_DPU_CLUSTER_VIP=<free-routable-ip>  # floating IP the DPUs use to reach their control plane
export NICO_DPF_BMC_ROOT_PASSWORD=<bmc-password>    # site-wide BMC root password
# Refer to helm-prereqs/README.md §DPF for full variable reference.

# 3. Customize site-specific values
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values/nico-core.yaml:
#      nico-api.hostname      — your site's external API hostname
#      nico-api.siteConfig    — network pools, VLAN ranges, IB config, MetalLB VIPs
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values/metallb-config.yaml:
#      IPAddressPool, BGPPeer    — your site's VIP ranges and TOR switch config
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values.yaml:
#      siteName                  — short site identifier

# 4. Run setup — installs common services, NICo Core, and NICo REST in order
cd helm-prereqs
./setup.sh                # interactive: prompts before deploying Core and REST
./setup.sh -y             # non-interactive: deploys everything including DPF (CI/CD)
./setup.sh -y --skip-dpf  # non-interactive: skip DPF (no DPUs, or still on iPXE)
```

To tear everything down:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs
./clean.sh
```
