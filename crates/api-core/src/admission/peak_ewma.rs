//! Conservative execution-duration estimator for admission backpressure.
//!
//! An exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) is a rolling average that
//! favors recent observations without retaining every historical sample. This
//! peak-biased variant incorporates a slow sample immediately and lets the
//! estimate decay as the service demonstrates faster execution.
//!
//! Queue pressure is measured in concurrency batches, so admission needs an
//! estimate of how long an admitted batch will take. A simple average can turn
//! optimistic immediately after a slow handler and admit work that is unlikely
//! to begin before its pending deadline. This deliberately favors protecting
//! the queue from overload over admitting work based on a stale, low-latency
//! estimate.
//!
//! Each client and the global scheduler maintain an independent estimator. The
//! estimates drive predictive queue-delay rejection and bounded, jittered retry
//! advice; they do not impose execution limits themselves.
