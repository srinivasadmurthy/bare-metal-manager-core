//! Host naming strategies.
//!
//! A machine interface's hostname is the DNS record name it resolves under (the
//! DNS views join `machine_interfaces.hostname` to its addresses to produce A /
//! AAAA records). How that hostname is derived is a deployment-wide policy,
//! selected once via [`crate::host_naming::HostNamingStrategyKind`] from
//! `CarbideConfig.host_naming_strategy` and applied wherever an interface is
//! [re]named.
//!
//! The policy is consulted at every naming-relevant event (a new interface, an
//! address gained or lost, an admin reconcile). Each strategy decides whether to
//! [`Naming::Assign`] a new hostname or [`Naming::Keep`] the stored one, so the
//! call sites stay uniform and strategy-agnostic:
//!
//! - [`IpHostNamingStrategy`] mirrors the address: it always reassigns, so the
//!   hostname tracks the current IP (today's behavior).
//! - [`FunHostNamingStrategy`] creates a stable adjective-noun handle once
//!   (e.g. `wholesale-walrus`) and keeps it across IP changes -- the DNS view
//!   repoints the record to the new address under the same name automatically.
//! - [`SerialNumberHostNamingStrategy`] names a host after its hardware serial.
//!   The serial isn't available on the DHCP/network plane, so the primary
//!   interface gets a temporary IP-based name and switches to the serial name
//!   once the machine is discovered and its [`NamingContext::machine_id`] is set.
//! - [`MacAddressHostNamingStrategy`] names every interface after its own MAC
//!   (`0a-1b-2c-3d-4e-5f`). The MAC is known from the first DHCP packet, so
//!   there is no temporary-name phase at all.
//!
//! Only `fun` leaves existing hostnames alone: it assigns a name only when the
//! stored one is a placeholder (a brand-new row or a `noip-...` dormant marker)
//! and otherwise keeps it, so a fleet adopts it organically as hosts cycle,
//! existing names -- and DNS -- untouched. The other styles re-derive (the name
//! tracks the current IP, the machine's serial, or the interface's MAC), so
//! switching to one of them progressively renames existing interfaces as the
//! address-sync and reconcile paths run.
//!
//! The identity-derived styles promise that the name *is* the identifier --
//! that's the whole point of choosing them. So when the fleet's data breaks
//! that promise (two machines reporting the same serial), `serial_number`
//! fails with a clear error instead of quietly assigning a substitute nobody
//! would think to look up in DNS. `mac_address` needs no such preflight: the
//! MAC name is injective (only rows for the very same MAC can share it), so
//! true duplicate MACs surface through the `(segment_id, mac_address)`
//! constraint and DHCP itself, and same-domain name conflicts are caught by
//! `fqdn_must_be_unique`.
