//! Runtime writer for the credential-rotation bookkeeping tables.
//!
//! `device_credential_rotation` records, per device and credential type, the
//! last confirmed version of the site-wide credential applied on the hardware --
//! the convergence marker the rotation engine drives toward
//! `sitewide_credential_rotation.target_version`.
//!
//! Already-ingested devices are populated once by the
//! `*_credential_rotation_backfill` data migration. This module records the
//! same fact at runtime, at the moment NICo actually sets a credential on a
//! device (factory -> site-wide at ingestion), so the table does not go stale
//! as new sites and new hardware are adopted. The migration handles "before the
//! upgrade"; these hooks handle "ever after".
//!
//! Ingestion hooks wired today (calling [`record_device_converged`]) record the
//! fact at the moment NICo writes the credential, not when the device row is
//! later persisted:
//!
//! * `bmc` -- at `site-explorer` `BmcEndpointExplorer::set_bmc_root_credentials`,
//!   the single point where every host, DPU, switch, and power-shelf BMC is
//!   moved onto (or confirmed on) the site-wide root and its per-device secret
//!   is written.
//! * `host_uefi` -- when the host UEFI password is set on the device
//!   (`api-core` `set_host_uefi_password` and the machine-controller UEFI-setup
//!   state, alongside stamping `machines.bios_password_set_time`).
//! * `dpu_uefi` -- when the DPU UEFI password is set on the device, at the
//!   machine-controller `DpuInitState::WaitingForPlatformConfiguration` state
//!   right after `uefi_setup(dpu = true)` succeeds (keyed by the DPU BMC MAC,
//!   mirroring the backfill).
//! * `lockdown_ikm` -- staged as a two-phase rotation keyed by the card (NIC)
//!   MAC, so the recorded convergence version is always the one the hardware was
//!   actually locked under rather than the (mutable) site-wide target re-read at
//!   observation time. When api-core issues the lock command it stamps the IKM
//!   version the lock key was derived from as the in-flight marker via
//!   [`mark_device_rotating_to_version`] (`rotating_to_version`); when
//!   dpa-manager `handle_locking` sees the card report Locked
//!   (`card_state.lockmode == Locked`) it promotes that exact value to
//!   `current_version` via [`promote_rotating_to_current`]. A card with no staged
//!   marker (locked before this flow shipped, already at v0 from the backfill)
//!   falls back to [`record_device_converged`] at the site-wide target. Today the
//!   locked-with version is `CURRENT_LOCKDOWN_IKM_VERSION` (0); the rotation
//!   engine will own advancing the site-wide target, and the staged
//!   `rotating_to_version` is exactly the crash-safety marker that keeps a
//!   mid-flight advance from mis-recording a card as converged to a version it
//!   was never locked under.
//!
//! NVOS stages its target before dispatch and records an optional backend job.
//! Missing or terminal job observations retry that exact target. Completion is
//! promoted only after per-device credential readback, with target, attempt, and
//! job comparisons fencing stale responses.
//!
//! Teardown hooks (calling [`delete_device_converged`]) remove a marker when the
//! credential it tracks is torn down, keeping the table honest:
//!
//! * `bmc` -- at `api-core` `delete_bmc_root_credentials_by_mac`, alongside
//!   deleting the per-device BMC secret. Once NICo discards the
//!   secret it can no longer authenticate or rotate, so the marker is meaningless.
//! * `host_uefi` -- in the `api-core` force-delete path, right after
//!   `clear_host_uefi_password` resets the password on the device: the host no
//!   longer carries the site-wide UEFI value, so the marker is false.
//!
//! Markers NICo does *not* tear down (the device keeps the site-wide credential,
//! or NICo keeps the secret) are left to the rotation engine, which must always
//! join `device_credential_rotation` to the live device tables when selecting
//! work so a row orphaned by device deletion is never acted on.
