//! Build-time orchestration for Carbide's shared protobuf schema.
//!
//! This crate is not an implementation or replacement of `protoc`.
//! [`crate::compile`] configures [`prost_build::Config`] to invoke `protoc` once
//! as a protobuf frontend: `protoc` parses and validates the input files,
//! resolves imports and type references, and emits a serialized
//! [`prost_types::FileDescriptorSet`]. That descriptor set is the schema
//! intermediate representation (IR) consumed by the Rust generators; `protoc`
//! does not generate Rust in this pipeline.
//!
//! ```text
//! .proto files
//!     -> one protoc invocation
//!     -> serialized FileDescriptorSet
//!     -> shared Schema
//!         -> prost/tonic Rust generation
//!         -> Forge wrapper generation
//!         -> NMX-C wrapper generation
//!         -> forge.bin for runtime gRPC reflection
//! ```
//!
//! [`crate::Schema`] retains three representations of the same schema because
//! no one representation satisfies every backend: exact serialized bytes, a
//! decoded [`prost_types::FileDescriptorSet`], and a semantic, indexed
//! [`prost_reflect::DescriptorPool`]. See the type's field documentation for
//! the role and fidelity of each view. The fixture tests
//! `raw_descriptor_pool_preserves_custom_option_values` and
//! `prost_reencoding_drops_custom_option_values` demonstrate why the exact
//! bytes and semantic view must not be reconstructed from the decoded
//! `prost_types` view.
//!
//! Carbide runs this pipeline from `crates/rpc/build.rs` as a Cargo build
//! script. The in-memory [`crate::Schema`] is discarded when the build script
//! exits; generated Rust and the `forge.bin` reflection descriptor remain in
//! Cargo's `OUT_DIR`.
