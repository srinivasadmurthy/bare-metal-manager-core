//! Power-shelf-controller BMC (PMC) credential rotation.
//!
//! The shared [`carbide_credential_rotation`] engine owns the password dance,
//! backoff, and crash-safety; this module is the thin power-shelf-controller
//! adapter, mirroring the switch-controller's `rotating_bmc.rs`. A power shelf
//! has exactly one BMC (its PMC), so there is no per-device fan-out: one
//! endpoint, one [`rotate_bmc`] call per tick.
//!
//! - *Should we enter rotation?* [`should_enter_bmc_rotation`] honors an operator
//!   force-converge request first (even when the site-wide flag is off), then the
//!   passive gate (`bmc_rotation_enabled` && the cached [`RotationGate`] says
//!   the PMC lags the staged target).
//! - *Do one rotation tick.* [`handle_rotating_bmc`] converges the PMC via
//!   [`rotate_bmc`], folds the outcome through the shared state-neutral
//!   [`advance`] retry seam, and returns to `Ready` (clearing a satisfied force
//!   request) or re-enters `RotatingBmc` with an incremented retry budget.
//!
//! Unlike the switch path (all NVIDIA MGX, so a fixed dispatch vendor), a power
//! shelf's Lite-On/Delta PMC vendor is not persisted and is not exposed in the
//! Redfish service root, so the engine probes it at rotation time
//! ([`BmcEndpoint::into_target_probing_vendor`]) -- the repo's standard
//! power-shelf vendor determination.
//!
//! A BMC password change never touches the power shelf's power delivery, so this
//! is safe in `Ready`.
