// LockdownManager is the main interface for managing device
// lockdown operations.
//
// Just to have this documented somewhere, it's important to call out
// a few notes around the behavior(s) with locking and unlocking cards.
//
// Behind the scenes, there's:
// - hw_access disable <device> <key>, which locks a card with a given key.
// - set_key disable <device> <key>, which does the exact same thing.
// - hw_access enable <device> <key>, which unlocks the card with the key.
//
// Originally I thought you had to set_key, and then you could lock at
// will, and had to unlock with the key. But it turns out that set_key
// and hw_access disable both appear to do the same thing now. If you try
// to call hw_access disable after set_key, it just tells you access
// is already disabled.
//
// I also thought you had to reboot/power cycle the card after changing
// the key, but based on testing, that also seems to not be the case
// either. Once you hw_access enable, it clears the key, and you need
// to either hw_access disable or set_key again (and can do it with a
// different key). This is actually nice, because I don't need to power
// cycle in between tenants (granted we will anyway, but it's one less
// power cycle to worry about).
//
// But fwiw, that behavior may also be card specific. I'm testing on
// a BF3 SuperNIC, and it's letting me do things as I described above.
