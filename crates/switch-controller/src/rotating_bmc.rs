//! Switch-controller BMC credential rotation.
//!
//! The shared [`carbide_credential_rotation`] engine owns the password dance,
//! backoff, and crash-safety; this module is the thin switch-controller adapter,
//! mirroring the machine-controller's `rotation.rs`. A switch has exactly one
//! BMC, so there is no per-device fan-out: one endpoint, one [`rotate_bmc`] call
//! per tick.
//!
//! - *Should we enter rotation?* [`should_enter_bmc_rotation`] honors an operator
//!   force-converge request first (even when the site-wide flag is off), then the
//!   passive gate (`bmc_rotation_enabled` && the cached [`RotationGate`] says
//!   the BMC lags the staged target).
//! - *Do one rotation tick.* [`handle_rotating_bmc`] converges the switch BMC via
//!   [`rotate_bmc`], folds the outcome through the shared state-neutral
//!   [`advance`] retry seam, and returns to `Ready` (clearing a satisfied force
//!   request) or re-enters `RotatingBmc` with an incremented retry budget.
//!
//! A BMC password change never touches the switch data plane, so this is safe in
//! `Ready`.
