//! Stateful firmware update simulation for bmc-mock.
//!
//! ## Design notes
//!
//! ### Transport independence
//! All upload paths (Redfish SimpleUpdate, AMI multipart `UpdateService/upload`)
//! converge on `record_upload()`.  The staging and task lifecycle are identical
//! regardless of which transport carbide uses.
//!
//! ### Component identification
//! When Targets is explicit (SimpleUpdate), the component is derived from the
//! target path.  When it is absent (multipart), the next entry is peeked from
//! `pending_upgrades` — a deterministic ordered map injected by machine-a-tron.
//! This avoids ambiguity when multiple components are outdated.
//!
//! ### Task lifecycle (NICo-compatible)
//! The upload POST returns immediately with the task in `Running` state (202).
//! A background task transitions to `Completed` after a configurable delay (with
//! jitter to avoid correlated resets across many simulated hosts).  Task state
//! and the staged firmware entry are written in a single critical section to
//! eliminate the race window between `Completed` and staging.
//!
//! The background task is spawned as fire-and-forget (the `JoinHandle` is
//! dropped).  This is intentional for a mock BMC: tasks are short-lived (seconds),
//! the process exits when the simulation ends, and panics inside the task would
//! only leave a task permanently in `Running` state — visible to a poll loop but
//! harmless to the rest of the simulation.
//!
//! ### Activation event
//! All staged firmware is applied on `BmcEvent::PowerOn`.  This is an explicit
//! simulation simplification: real UEFI updates trigger a host restart while
//! real BMC updates trigger `Manager.Reset` (currently a no-op in bmc-mock).
//! Per-component activation events can be added in a follow-up.
//!
//! ### Non-destructive queue
//! `pending_upgrades` is an `IndexMap<component_id, target_version>` (ordered,
//! key-addressed).  Uploads `peek` the first entry without consuming it.  The
//! entry is only removed when `apply_staged_firmware` successfully stages the
//! version on PowerOn.  This makes upload retries safe: a failed or repeated
//! upload keeps the same queue entry available for the next attempt.
//!
//! ### Response format
//! Every upload response includes **both** the `Location` header (for Dell/DGX H100)
//! and a full Task JSON body (for GB200/GB300/Lenovo), satisfying all platform
//! contracts.
//!
//! ### Load isolation
//! All task and inventory state lives in `UpdateServiceState` behind `Arc`.
//! Each simulated BMC gets its own `Arc<UpdateServiceState>` (via `BmcState`),
//! so state is fully isolated per host.
//! Uploaded image bytes are streamed frame-by-frame and discarded without
//! buffering to avoid unbounded memory use.
