//! Pause site-explorer probing of a BMC while its credentials are changed.
//!
//! Site-explorer authenticates BMCs directly and, on a 401, persists a sticky
//! `Unauthorized` latch (`AvoidLockout`) in `explored_endpoints` that blocks
//! allocations and never self-heals. Whenever a controller changes a BMC's
//! credential -- a credential rotation, or the factory-reset-then-restore run
//! during tenant release -- there is a window where the hardware carries one
//! password but Vault (or the just-issued reset) leaves another in play; a probe
//! in that window 401s and latches.
//!
//! To close that window, a controller records a
//! [`BmcSuppressionSubsystem::SiteExplorer`] suppression for the BMC MAC and
//! waits until site-explorer has *acknowledged* it before changing any
//! credential. Site-explorer stamps `acknowledged_at` only after it has claimed
//! the endpoint idle at the top of its single-flight iteration, so an
//! acknowledged suppression is an exact "site-explorer has observed this, no
//! probe is in flight, and every future probe skips this MAC" barrier. With the
//! probe held off, no latch can form, so nothing needs to be cleared on the
//! happy path; the controller simply deletes its suppression when it returns to
//! a steady state.
//!
//! This module is state-machine-neutral so the machine-, switch-, and
//! power-shelf-controllers' rotation flows and the machine-controller's
//! host-BMC factory-reset flow share one implementation. Each caller passes its
//! own suppression `reason` so deletes stay scoped to the rows that caller owns
//! (a factory reset never removes a rotation's suppression, or vice versa). The
//! whole gate is re-derived from the suppression row each tick (its
//! `requested_at` is the wait-budget clock and its `acknowledged_at` is the
//! barrier), so callers need no new persisted sub-state.
