//! One declaration per significant event: [`emit`] produces a structured log
//! line and/or a Prometheus metric from the same call, correlated by the
//! surrounding span, with metric cardinality bounded by the type system.
//!
//! Declare the event as a struct next to the code that emits it:
//!
//! ```
//! use carbide_instrument::{Event, LabelValue, Outcome, emit};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, LabelValue)]
//! enum Backend {
//!     Nsm,
//!     Psm,
//!     Rms,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Event)]
//! #[event(
//!     event_name  = "power_control_failed",       // stable event identity
//!     metric_name = "carbide_power_control_total", // exposed verbatim
//!     component = "component_manager",
//!     log       = warn,                          // error|warn|info|debug|trace|off
//!     metric    = counter,                       // counter | histogram | none
//!     describe  = "Number of power control operations that failed", // counter HELP text
//!     message   = "power control failed",
//! )]
//! struct PowerControlFailed {
//!     #[label]
//!     backend: Backend, // enum -> metric label backend="rms"
//!     #[label]
//!     outcome: Outcome, // enum -> metric label outcome="error"
//!     #[context]
//!     error: String, // high-cardinality -> the log line only
//! }
//!
//! emit(PowerControlFailed {
//!     backend: Backend::Rms,
//!     outcome: Outcome::Error,
//!     error: "deadline exceeded".to_string(),
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! The two knobs are independent: `log = off, metric = counter` counts a
//! hot-path event without building any log line at all, and `metric = none`
//! is a plain structured log. See `docs/observability/instrumentation.md`
//! for the standard (naming, cardinality rules, when to use which mode).
//!
//! # Cardinality is enforced by the types
//!
//! A `#[label]` field must implement [`LabelValue`], which is derivable only
//! for fieldless enums -- so a label's value set is closed by construction.
//! `String` does not implement it, and high-cardinality detail belongs in
//! `#[context]` fields, which appear on the log line only:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total",
//!         component = "demo", log = off, metric = counter,
//!         describe = "Number of demo events")]
//! struct Demo {
//!     #[label]
//!     machine_id: String, // ERROR: String is not a LabelValue
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `#[context]` formats through `Display` by default. `#[context(value)]` is
//! the opt-in for fields whose tracing type is part of the structured-log
//! contract; it accepts `bool`, `i64`, `f64`, or `String`:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(
//!     event_name = "retry_scheduled",
//!     component = "demo",
//!     message = "retry scheduled"
//! )]
//! struct RetryScheduled {
//!     #[context(value)]
//!     retry_interval_seconds: f64,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A context field that does not apply to every case an event covers is
//! written `Option<T>`. `None` leaves the key off the log line entirely, rather
//! than writing a blank or a stand-in value -- which is the only honest form
//! for a typed field, since there is no empty `WorkerId`:
//!
//! ```
//! use std::net::IpAddr;
//!
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(
//!     event_name = "upload_failed",
//!     component = "demo",
//!     log = warn,
//!     message = "upload failed"
//! )]
//! struct UploadFailed {
//!     #[context]
//!     peer: Option<IpAddr>, // absent when the upload never reached a peer
//!     #[context]
//!     error: String,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The check is syntactic: it recognizes `Option<T>` spelled bare or through
//! `std`/`core`, and leaves any other type named `Option` alone. A type alias
//! for an option is therefore not recognized as one, which surfaces as a
//! compile error at the generated call rather than a silently wrong log line.
//! `#[context(value)]` keeps its own types and rejects `Option<...>`, pointing
//! at `#[context]` instead.
//!
//! `#[label(name = "component")]` exists for a frozen metric key that cannot
//! also be the Rust field name because Event logs reserve `component`. For a
//! field such as `publisher: Publisher`, the metric keeps `component` while
//! the generated log keeps `publisher`. Context and observation fields do not
//! support this compatibility alias.
//!
//! # One metric, several events
//!
//! When a second event needs the same metric, declare the metric once as a
//! [`MetricFamily`] and point both events at it. The family owns the name, the
//! kind, the description, the component, and the label set; each event states
//! only its own identity, level, message, and context:
//!
//! ```
//! use carbide_instrument::{Event, LabelValue, MetricFamily, Outcome, emit};
//!
//! #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, LabelValue)]
//! enum Stage {
//!     Fetch,
//!     Persist,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(MetricFamily)]
//! #[metric(
//!     name = "carbide_inventory_failures_total",
//!     kind = counter,                       // counter | histogram
//!     component = "site_explorer",
//!     describe = "Number of inventory failures, by stage and outcome",
//! )]
//! struct InventoryFailures {
//!     stage: Stage, // every field is a label
//!     outcome: Outcome,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Event)]
//! #[event(
//!     event_name = "inventory_fetch_failed",
//!     metric_family = InventoryFailures,           // the family, not a kind
//!     log = warn,
//!     message = "inventory fetch failed",
//! )]
//! struct FetchFailed {
//!     #[label]
//!     stage: Stage,
//!     #[label]
//!     outcome: Outcome,
//!     #[context]
//!     error: String, // this event's own detail
//! }
//!
//! emit(FetchFailed {
//!     stage: Stage::Fetch,
//!     outcome: Outcome::Error,
//!     error: "deadline exceeded".to_string(),
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! The event still declares its `#[label]` fields, so its log line is
//! unchanged -- the derive builds the family from them by name, which is what
//! holds the two sides together. A label the family does not know, or one it
//! knows and the event forgot, is an ordinary compile error:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use carbide_instrument::{Event, LabelValue, MetricFamily, Outcome};
//! # #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, LabelValue)]
//! # enum Stage { Fetch }
//! # #[derive(MetricFamily)]
//! # #[metric(name = "carbide_demo_family_total", kind = counter, component = "demo",
//! #          describe = "Number of demo failures")]
//! # struct DemoFailures { stage: Stage, outcome: Outcome }
//! #[derive(Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo_failed", metric_family = DemoFailures, log = warn, message = "demo")]
//! struct DemoFailed {
//!     #[label]
//!     stage: Stage, // ERROR: missing field `outcome` in initializer of `DemoFailures`
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Reach for a family only when two or more events move the same metric. A
//! metric one event owns stays declared inline on that event -- and because
//! the family owns the metric side, an event that names one must not restate
//! it:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! # use carbide_instrument::{Event, LabelValue, MetricFamily, Outcome};
//! # #[derive(MetricFamily)]
//! # #[metric(name = "carbide_demo_family_total", kind = counter, component = "demo",
//! #          describe = "Number of demo failures")]
//! # struct DemoFailures {}
//! #[derive(Event)]
//! #[event(
//!     event_name = "demo_failed",
//!     metric_family = DemoFailures,
//!     metric_name = "carbide_demo_family_total", // ERROR: the family declares this
//!     log = warn,
//!     message = "demo",
//! )]
//! struct DemoFailed {}
//! ```
//!
//! The metric name is validated at compile time -- the `carbide_` prefix, the
//! `_total` suffix for counters, a unit suffix for histograms:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "power_control", metric_name = "power_control_total",
//!         component = "demo", log = off, metric = counter)]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: metric names use the `carbide_` prefix
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "power_control", metric_name = "carbide_power_control",
//!         component = "demo", log = off, metric = counter)]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: counter names end in `_total`
//! ```
//!
//! And an event must produce something -- `log = off` with `metric = none`
//! would make `emit()` a silent no-op:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", component = "demo", log = off, metric = none)]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: declare at least one side
//! ```
//!
//! `unit` belongs to histograms (and only `metric_name_unchecked` ones -- a
//! standard histogram name already declares its unit as the suffix), and
//! `describe` documents a metric:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total",
//!         component = "demo", log = off, metric = counter, unit = "s")]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: `unit` is only valid for histogram metrics
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", component = "demo", message = "demo", describe = "demo")]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: `describe` documents a metric; this event has metric = none
//! ```
//!
//! A counter documents itself: `describe` is required and opens with
//! "Number of ..." (the tech-writer house rule, so the `core_metrics.md`
//! catalogue reads consistently):
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total", component = "demo",
//!         log = off, metric = counter)]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: a counter must document itself with describe = "Number of ..."
//! ```
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total", component = "demo",
//!         log = off, metric = counter, describe = "Total number of demos")]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: a counter's describe opens with "Number of ..."
//! ```
//!
//! A counter name ends in `_total` (Prometheus convention) but not
//! `_total_total` -- the framework strips one `_total` before registering and
//! the exporter appends it back, so a doubled suffix ships a `_total_total`
//! series:
//!
//! ```compile_fail
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total_total", component = "demo",
//!         log = off, metric = counter, describe = "Number of demos")]
//! struct Demo {} // ERROR: counter name ends in `_total_total`
//! ```
//!
//! Both checks have a greppable escape hatch for grandfathered metrics --
//! `describe_unchecked` for the text, `metric_name_unchecked` for the name:
//!
//! ```
//! #[derive(carbide_instrument::Event)]
//! #[event(event_name = "demo", metric_name = "carbide_demo_total_total", component = "demo",
//!         log = off, metric = counter, metric_name_unchecked,
//!         describe = "Total number of demos", describe_unchecked)]
//! struct Demo {}
//! ```
