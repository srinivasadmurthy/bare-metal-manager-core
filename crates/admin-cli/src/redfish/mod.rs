// `redfish` is intentionally OUTSIDE the `Dispatch`/`Run` trait flow: it talks
// straight to a machine's BMC, so `main` handles it *before* the API client
// (and thus `RuntimeContext`) is built -- see the `CliCommand::Redfish` branch
// in `main.rs`, which calls `redfish::action` directly. Those traits carry a
// `RuntimeContext` redfish never has, so it stays a plain `action` fn rather
// than implementing them. Please don't "realign" it onto the traits.
