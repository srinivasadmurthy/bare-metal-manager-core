EXAMPLES:

Delete a machine interface by ID (redeploy kea afterward):
    $ nico-admin-cli machine-interfaces delete 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567

Delete a leftover interface when you only have the BMC MAC (e.g. a replacement host
whose ingestion is blocked by a stale interface record):
    $ nico-admin-cli machine-interfaces delete --mac-address 00:11:22:33:44:55
