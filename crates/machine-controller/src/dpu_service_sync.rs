//! Releasing the DPF maintenance hold that parks a host's DPUs while a changed
//! DPUService waits to roll out.
//!
//! Shared by the two callers that can decide to lift a hold: the `Ready` state
//! handler, which does it on carbide's own initiative for idle hosts, and the
//! admin API, which does it for a host an operator has named. They differ in
//! which hosts they are willing to consider, not in what "safe to release" means
//! -- so the decision lives here once and the gates stay with the callers.
