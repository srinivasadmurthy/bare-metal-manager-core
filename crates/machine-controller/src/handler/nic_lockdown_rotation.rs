//! Machine-controller SuperNIC lockdown IKM rekey (`RotatingNicLockdown`).
//!
//! This is the idle-card completion path for NIC lockdown rotation, the direct
//! analog of the shipped host-UEFI Ready-entered rotation ([`super::host_uefi_rotation`]).
//! Lazy migration on the tenant cycle never completes for cards on idle `Ready`
//! hosts, because tenant release does **not** unlock a card -- it sits locked
//! under the old IKM indefinitely. This state drives every lagging SuperNIC
//! (SVPC) card on an otherwise-idle host through a tenant-free
//! `RotateKeyUnlocking -> RotateKeyLocking` cycle (unlock at the IKM the card is
//! locked under, relock at the site-wide target), waiting until each card
//! converges or is quarantined.
//!
//! Unlike the host/DPU credentials, the actual key change is performed by the
//! DPA interface state machine + scout, not by a Redfish/BIOS job. So this
//! module is a thin driver: it decides *whether* to enter
//! ([`should_enter_nic_lockdown_rotation`]) and, once in the state, kicks idle
//! cards into the rekey cycle, bounds unreachable cards with a per-step timeout +
//! backoff quarantine so the host never wedges, and returns to `Ready` once every
//! card has converged or been attempted ([`handle_rotating_nic_lockdown`]).
//!
//! Convergence/quarantine is recorded against the same `device_credential_rotation`
//! bookkeeping the other families use, keyed by each card's **NIC MAC**.
