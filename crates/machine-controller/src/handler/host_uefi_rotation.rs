//! Machine-controller host UEFI credential rotation.
//!
//! The BMC sibling ([`super::rotation`]) delegates the whole password dance to
//! the shared [`carbide_credential_rotation`] engine because a BMC password
//! change is a single synchronous Redfish call. Host UEFI is different: applying
//! a new password requires a BIOS config job plus a full host power-cycle, so
//! the convergence itself is a multi-tick FSM
//! ([`super::handle_rotating_host_uefi`]). This module is the thin
//! policy/bookkeeping adapter around that FSM:
//!
//! - *Should we enter rotation?* [`should_enter_host_uefi_rotation`] honors an
//!   operator force-converge request unconditionally, else fires the passive
//!   [`RotationGate`](carbide_credential_rotation::RotationGate) only when UEFI
//!   rotation is enabled site-wide.
//! - *What credential authenticates the change?*
//!   [`host_uefi_current_candidates`] resolves the ordered, versioned
//!   current-password candidates -- the engine-free equivalent of the BMC
//!   `change_or_recover` candidate walk.
//! - *Clear the one-shot force request* once a forced rotation has run.
//!
//! Convergence/quarantine is recorded against the same
//! `device_credential_rotation` bookkeeping the BMC engine uses, keyed by the
//! host BMC MAC (mirroring the ingestion setup path and the backfill).
//!
//! This module rotates the host UEFI only. DPU UEFI rotation lives in its own
//! sibling `RotatingDpuUefi` state: it too stages a BIOS settings job and reboots
//! (the DPU, not the host), is keyed by the DPU BMC MAC, and a host can carry
//! several DPUs -- distinct enough from the host flow to keep the two states
//! separate rather than overloading this one.
