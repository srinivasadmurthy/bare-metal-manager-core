//! Machine-controller BMC credential rotation.
//!
//! The shared [`carbide_credential_rotation`] engine owns the actual password
//! dance, backoff, and crash-safety; this module is the thin machine-controller
//! adapter. It answers two questions for the state machine:
//!
//! - *Should we enter rotation?* [`bmc_rotation_needed`] asks the cached
//!   [`RotationGate`] whether the host BMC or any of its DPU BMCs lags the
//!   staged site-wide target. The gate keeps the steady state at one cheap
//!   aggregate query per TTL window (see the engine crate docs).
//! - *Do one rotation tick.* [`rotate_managed_host_bmcs`] converges the host BMC
//!   and each DPU BMC toward the target via [`rotate_bmc`], then reports whether
//!   the tick settled (every device reached a terminal outcome) or hit a
//!   transient bookkeeping failure worth retrying.
//!
//! A BMC password change never touches host power or the running OS, so this is
//! safe both for pool hosts (top-level [`ManagedHostState::RotatingBmc`]) and
//! under live tenancy (`Assigned/RotatingBmc`).
