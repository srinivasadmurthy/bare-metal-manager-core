//! Releases the DPF maintenance hold for hosts whose DPUs are already running
//! the software their DPUDeployment declares.
//!
//! A DPUService change (helm chart or image version) drives every affected DPU
//! into the NodeEffect phase, where DPF waits for permission to disrupt it.
//! Granting that permission is only correct for a DPU that is otherwise up to
//! date: one still awaiting reprovisioning is about to have its OS replaced, and
//! the new services may not run on the OS currently installed.
//!
//! Scope: this decides *when* a declared service version reaches a DPU, not
//! *whether* that version belongs there. It asks only whether the DPU matches
//! its DPUDeployment, so a deployment that pairs a service version with an
//! incompatible BFB is rolled out faithfully. Keeping those versions coherent is
//! the operator's responsibility, deliberately -- a compatibility check here
//! would also reject the test builds that qualifying a new service depends on.
//!
//! Runs from the `Ready` arm only. `Ready` is not the only state where releasing
//! a hold would be safe -- `HostInit` has provisioned DPUs and no tenant either
//! -- but keeping the automatic path narrow means it can never collide with the
//! DPF states where NICo itself drives DPU operations.
//!
//! The accepted cost is that a host which never reaches `Ready` never receives a
//! service update. That matters most when the update *is* the fix: a DPUService
//! version that breaks host provisioning strands hosts in `HostInit`, and they
//! cannot be repaired by the automatic path. Recovering those is an explicit
//! operator action rather than something this handler infers.
