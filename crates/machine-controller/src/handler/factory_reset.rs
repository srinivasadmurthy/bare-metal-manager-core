//! Deletion-only, site-gated host BMC factory-reset sub-flow.
//!
//! Tenant release already power-cycles the host, wipes NVMe, and re-verifies
//! BIOS/boot-order. This sub-state machine runs *first*, factory-resetting the
//! host BMC to proactively clear wedged BMC state (bad/rejected boot order seen
//! on GB200, Grace-Grace, SMC) before the existing `PowerCycle` flow takes over.
//!
//! The flow, keyed off [`FactoryResetBmcState`]:
//! 1. [`CheckPreconditions`](FactoryResetBmcState::CheckPreconditions) - run once
//!    on entry: the site gate (transparent pass-through to `PowerCycle` when
//!    disabled) and a one-shot check for a usable `expected_machines` factory-cred
//!    entry, skipping the reset (straight to `PowerCycle`) when it is absent so a
//!    config gap never parks the release. Kept separate from the
//!    acknowledgement-wait below so the `expected_machines` lookup runs once, not
//!    on every controller dispatch during the wait.
//! 2. [`SuppressExploration`](FactoryResetBmcState::SuppressExploration) - use the
//!    shared [`site_explorer_pause`] handshake (the same one BMC rotation uses)
//!    to idempotently suppress site-explorer for the host BMC and wait for it to
//!    acknowledge (proceeding anyway once the shared pause budget elapses).
//! 3. [`ResetToDefaults`](FactoryResetBmcState::ResetToDefaults) - issue
//!    `Manager.ResetToDefaults` with stored credentials.
//! 4. [`WaitForBmc`](FactoryResetBmcState::WaitForBmc) - wait for an anonymous
//!    service-root read to succeed (polls at the controller cadence; never
//!    parks - a BMC that never returns is surfaced by the time-in-state SLA).
//! 5. [`RestoreCredentials`](FactoryResetBmcState::RestoreCredentials) - first a
//!    login-backoff probe of the factory creds (never parks; degrades to hourly
//!    polling to avoid BMC auth-lockout), with a per-device crash-recovery probe;
//!    then, once verified, change the BMC root password from factory default
//!    back to the device's previous per-device credential read from Vault. Vault
//!    is never written or deleted; any site-wide drift is left to the passive
//!    `RotatingBmc` rotation later. A genuine password-change failure parks.
//! 6. [`RemoveSuppression`](FactoryResetBmcState::RemoveSuppression) - delete the
//!    suppression and hand off to `PowerCycle`.
//!
//! Failures in reset / restore park the instance (blocking termination) per the
//! feature's failure-handling requirement. `WaitForBmc` instead keeps waiting
//! (blocking termination too) and leans on the time-in-state SLA to surface a
//! BMC that never returns.
//!
//! ## Per-vendor `bmc_reset_to_defaults` semantics (verified against libredfish)
//!
//! The restore target is always `expected_machines.bmc_password`, so that value
//! must be whatever credential the BMC presents *after* its reset for each SKU:
//! - NVIDIA GB200 (`nvidia_gbx00`), Grace-Grace/GH200 (`nvidia_gh200`), and SMC
//!   AMI/Viking (`ami`), plus Dell (`dell`), Lenovo, and HPE all issue the
//!   standard `Manager.ResetToDefaults` with `ResetType: ResetAll`, landing on a
//!   fixed factory-default credential captured at ingestion.
//! - Supermicro (`supermicro`) instead issues the OEM `SmcManagerConfig.Reset`
//!   with `Option: ClearConfig`, which restores the *unique per-chassis factory
//!   password printed on the chassis label* - not a fixed default. So for a
//!   Supermicro host, `expected_machines.bmc_password` must hold that
//!   chassis-label password, or `RestoreCredentials` degrades to hourly polling
//!   until an operator corrects it (it never parks there, so it self-heals).
//! - Dell's `Manager.ResetToDefaults` is issued with no lockdown unlock (the
//!   admin CLI does the same and no evidence of a lockdown rejection was found).
//!   If a locked-down iDRAC ever rejects it, `ResetToDefaults` returns a
//!   non-`NotSupported` error and the instance parks for operator attention
//!   rather than silently attempting a speculative unlock.
