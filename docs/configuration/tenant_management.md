# Tenant Management

Operator guide for tenant creation, resource allocation, and instance provisioning on NICo, using nicocli (REST API CLI) as the primary tool.

This is a Day 1 (Configuration) activity in NICo's lifecycle model -- the phase after hardware has been discovered, validated, and ingested (Day 0). Day 1 is when operators configure tenant boundaries, define resource allocations, and provision instances so tenants can consume bare-metal infrastructure.

The primary tool throughout this guide is `nicocli`, the CLI client that wraps the NICo REST API. Every REST endpoint is available as a CLI command, and nicocli handles authentication, token refresh, and multi-environment configuration automatically. The nico-admin-cli (which talks to the Core gRPC API) is referenced only where an operation has no REST API equivalent.

## Before You Start

This guide assumes you have completed the [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.md), which covers NICo deployment, site creation, and host discovery (Day Zero). You should already have:

- A running NICo deployment with healthy REST API, database, Temporal workflow engine, and at least one site controller.
- At least one site registered and in `Registered` status, with machines discovered and available for allocation.
- `nicocli` installed (`make nico-cli` from the `rest-api/` directory of the `infra-controller` repo) and reachable on `$PATH`.

If you plan to enable SPIFFE JWT-SVID **machine identity**, complete [Day 0 Machine Identity](../getting-started/installation-options/day0-machine-identity.md) before provisioning instances, then configure per-org identity after tenants exist. Refer to [Machine Identity](machine_identity.md).

<Tip title="CLI naming">
Older docs reference `carbidecli` (built via `make carbide-cli`). It's the same source under a previous name. This guide uses `nicocli` (built via `make nico-cli`) consistently.
</Tip>

For nicocli mechanics and conventions (flag ordering, `api.name` selection, `--data` vs flag forms, output formats, pagination, `--debug`), see the nicocli reference guide. The examples in this guide assume you've read it.

### Roles Required

NICo's authorization model has three roles, all managed in the upstream identity provider (any OIDC-compatible IdP, e.g. Keycloak):

| Role | Scope | Required For |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Provider Admin (`PROVIDER_ADMIN`) | Infrastructure provider org | Creating allocations, managing tenant accounts, managing sites and instance types |
| Provider Viewer (`PROVIDER_VIEWER`) | Infrastructure provider org | Read-only access to provider-scoped resources |
| Tenant Admin (`TENANT_ADMIN`) | Tenant org | Managing the tenant's instances, VPCs, VPC Prefixes, Subnets, and SSH keys |

A single user can hold roles in multiple orgs simultaneously. On dev/service-account orgs, one user typically holds both Provider Admin and Tenant Admin in the same org.

These roles are not settable through NICo. They are assigned in the identity provider and read from each request's token, which makes them a Day 0 concern that has to be in place before any of the Day 1 steps below will work. [Authentication and Authorization](/rest-api-reference/authentication-and-authorization) is the authoritative reference for that configuration, covering both the `issuers` and `keycloak` modes, the four claim-mapping recipes, and the deployment surfaces where each value belongs.

### Authentication

The Quick Start covers `nicocli login` end-to-end for Keycloak-backed deployments (the default for `setup.sh` installs). For other identity providers and for the static-token / token-command flows useful in automation, see the nicocli reference guide.

### Verifying Connectivity

Confirm that nicocli can reach the API and your credentials are valid:

```bash
nicocli site list
nicocli user get
```

`nicocli user get` returns your identity as NICo sees it.

## Creating a Tenant

### How Tenant Creation Works

NICo uses a lazy creation model for tenants. There is no explicit "create tenant" API call. Instead, a tenant record is automatically created the first time a Tenant Admin retrieves the current tenant for their organization:

```bash
nicocli tenant current
```

If no tenant exists for the configured org, NICo creates one and returns it. If a tenant already exists, the same command returns the existing record. The operation is idempotent.

Each tenant maps one-to-one to an organization in the configured identity provider. The tenant's identity (org name, display name) is derived from the IdP's org metadata -- there are no separate fields to supply.

In TUI mode:

```bash
nicocli tui
> tenant current
```

### Required Conditions

- The authenticated user must be a member of the organization specified in the nicocli config (`api.org`).
- The user must hold the Tenant Admin role within that org.

If either condition is not met, the API returns HTTP 403. NICo trusts whatever the IdP says in the token's claims, so getting these conditions met is an IdP administration task. It is not done through nicocli or the NICo API. The [Quick Start Guide](../getting-started/quick-start.md) walks through the bundled Keycloak reference implementation (a dev Keycloak deployed by `setup.sh` with a pre-loaded realm), which is the simplest path for first-time setup. For production, point NICo at any OIDC-compatible IdP (Keycloak, Okta, Auth0, your existing enterprise IdP) by configuring the `issuers` block in `nico-rest-api`'s config. Refer to [Authentication and Authorization](/rest-api-reference/authentication-and-authorization) for the deployment-side wiring. Its "Provider with Multiple Tenant IdPs" example is the recipe for one provider org serving tenants that each authenticate through their own identity provider.

For Keycloak deployments, [Tenant Management with Keycloak](tenant-management-keycloak.md) covers the realm-side steps in full: the realm role naming convention NICo reads as org membership, creating the Tenant's identity, and granting the privileged Tenant capability.

### Worked Example

```bash
$ nicocli tenant current
{
  "capabilities": {
    "targetedInstanceCreation": true
  },
  "created": "2026-04-23T01:11:07.452525Z",
  "id": "<tenant-uuid>",
  "org": "acme-corp",
  "orgDisplayName": "Acme Corporation",
  "updated": "2026-04-28T18:20:10.438572Z"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID identifier for the tenant, used in all subsequent API calls |
| `org` | Organization name (matches your config `api.org`) |
| `orgDisplayName` | Human-readable name pulled from the IdP's org metadata |
| `capabilities.targetedInstanceCreation` | **Deprecated, removal scheduled for October 1, 2026.** A read-only aggregate across the tenant's `Ready` tenant accounts, not a setting on the tenant. It is `true` only when every such account enables the capability and no site override disables it, and it is absent rather than `false` when disabled: the field is omitted, and on the `tenantSummary` objects embedded in other resources `capabilities` is always `{}`. A Provider Admin configures the capability per tenant account, and optionally per site. See [Granting Targeted Instance Creation](#granting-targeted-instance-creation). |

### Verifying the Tenant

Check tenant health with the stats endpoint:

```bash
nicocli tenant stats
```

Example response for a tenant in active use:

```json
{
  "instance": {"error": 0, "pending": 0, "ready": 6, "registering": 0, "terminating": 0, "total": 6, "updating": 0},
  "subnet": {"deleting": 0, "error": 0, "pending": 0, "provisioning": 0, "ready": 0, "total": 0},
  "tenantAccount": {"error": 0, "invited": 0, "pending": 0, "ready": 1, "total": 1},
  "vpc": {"deleting": 0, "error": 0, "pending": 0, "provisioning": 0, "ready": 2, "total": 2}
}
```

A freshly created tenant shows all zeroes. In TUI mode: `tenant stats`. Status keys in the response are alphabetical, not lifecycle order.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

When `GET /v2/org/{org}/nico/tenant/current` is called and no tenant exists, the API:

1. Validates org membership and the Tenant Admin role.
2. Creates a tenant record in the database with name, org, and display name pulled from the IdP claims in the token.
3. Links any pre-existing tenant account invitations referencing this org.
4. Returns the new tenant as JSON with HTTP 200.

Subsequent calls return the existing tenant. If the org's display name has changed in the IdP, NICo silently updates it on the next call.

## Establishing a Tenant Account

A tenant alone cannot consume infrastructure -- it needs a tenant account that links it to an infrastructure provider. This is a provider-side operation requiring the Provider Admin role.

### Creating the Link

```bash
nicocli tui
> tenant-account create
```

The TUI prompts for the infrastructure provider ID and the tenant org name. Non-interactive (using individual flags):

```bash
nicocli tenant-account create --infrastructure-provider-id <provider-uuid> --tenant-org acme-corp
```

The tenant account starts in `Invited` status. Listing tenant accounts requires a filter flag -- the bare `nicocli tenant-account list` returns HTTP 400:

```bash
nicocli tenant-account list --tenant-id <tenant-uuid>
nicocli tenant-account list --infrastructure-provider-id <provider-uuid>
```

Example tenant account detail (Ready, with active allocations):

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "<auto-generated>",
  "allocationCount": 4,
  "id": "<account-uuid>",
  "infrastructureProviderId": "<provider-uuid>",
  "infrastructureProviderOrg": "acme-infra",
  "status": "Ready",
  "subscriptionId": null,
  "subscriptionTier": null,
  "tenantContact": null,
  "tenantId": "<tenant-uuid>",
  "tenantOrg": "acme-corp"
}
```

`accountNumber` is auto-generated. `allocationCount` is a live count of allocations under this account. `tenantContact` records the user who accepted the invitation (null until accepted, or null when the same org is both provider and tenant).

### Accepting the Invitation (Tenant Side)

The tenant admin accepts the invitation, which moves the account to `Ready`.

Accepting is a tenant call, so `nicocli` has to act as the tenant. Two things decide who it acts as: the token it sends, and the org in the request path. Both have to name the tenant org.

Give the tenant its own config file, and set `api.org` to the tenant org in it. Pass that file with `--config` to `nicocli login` and to every tenant command. The request then carries the tenant's token, which can act only in orgs it holds a role for. If it holds no role for the org in `api.org`, the request fails with `403 Requested organization not found in token claims`. If it holds roles in several orgs, `api.org` picks which one it acts as.

Don't log in to the provider's config file. Login overwrites the provider's `auth.oidc` credentials there. A provider token in `auth.token` also outranks `auth.oidc.token`. In that case the tenant's login changes nothing that is sent.

On Keycloak deployments, [Pointing `nicocli` at the Tenant Org](tenant-management-keycloak.md#pointing-nicocli-at-the-tenant-org) has the commands.

To accept, send an empty PATCH body. Flags go before the account ID:

```bash
nicocli --config ~/.nico/<tenant-org>.yaml tenant-account update --data '{}' <account-id>
```

Or use the TUI:

```bash
nicocli --config ~/.nico/<tenant-org>.yaml tui
> tenant-account update
```

Only an account in `Invited` status can be accepted. An account that is already `Ready` returns this error:

```bash
$ nicocli --config ~/.nico/<tenant-org>.yaml tenant-account update --data '{}' <account-id>
Error: API error 400: Tenant Account status is not Invited
```

### Granting Targeted Instance Creation

`targetedInstanceCreation` is the privileged tenant capability. A tenant that has it can:

- Create an instance against a specific machine ID, or narrow placement with a machine label selector.
- Set `isRepairTenant: true` when releasing an instance, which is what the repair tenant workflow requires.
- Read a set of otherwise provider-only resources, including machines, machine health, SKUs, racks, trays, and expected machines, at the sites of a provider it holds a `Ready` tenant account with, wherever the capability is effective. A site override that disables it also removes these reads at that site.
- Receive alternative VPC routing profiles from `tenant/current/routing-profile`.

A Provider Admin configures it per tenant account with the `siteCapabilities` field. This is
the only supported way to grant it, and it applies to regular tenants as well as
service-account orgs:

```bash
nicocli tenant-account update \
  --data '{"siteCapabilities":[{"siteIds":[],"targetedInstanceCreation":true}]}' \
  <account-id>
```

#### Payload rules

- Exactly one entry must have an empty or omitted `siteIds`. That entry sets the account-level default.
- Any further entry lists site IDs that override the default. Each site must already be associated with the tenant, which happens when the tenant's first allocation at that site is created.
- No site ID may appear in more than one entry.
- `targetedInstanceCreation` is required on every entry.
- The request must not also carry `tenantContactId`, which is the invitation-acceptance field. Sending both returns HTTP 400.

Updates use replace semantics. A per-site override whose site ID is omitted from a later
payload is cleared. To leave the capability on everywhere except one site, send both
entries together:

```json
{
  "siteCapabilities": [
    {"siteIds": [], "targetedInstanceCreation": true},
    {"siteIds": ["<site-uuid>"], "targetedInstanceCreation": false}
  ]
}
```

#### How the effective value resolves

Three inputs decide whether the capability is in force for a tenant at a given site:

1. The tenant account must be `Ready`. Setting the capability on an `Invited` account grants nothing until the tenant accepts.
2. The account-level default applies where no site override exists.
3. A site override, when present, wins over the account default.

Because the account is per provider, a tenant with accounts at two providers can be
privileged at one and not the other.

#### Reading the current value

`nicocli tenant-account list` returns `siteCapabilities` and is the source of truth:

```bash
nicocli tenant-account list --tenant-id <tenant-uuid>
```

<Warning title="Deprecation">
Do not read `capabilities.targetedInstanceCreation` from `nicocli tenant current`. It is a deprecated read-only aggregate, scheduled for removal on **October 1, 2026**. It reports `true` only when every `Ready` tenant account enables the capability and no site override disables it, and it is omitted rather than returned as `false` otherwise, so a client cannot branch on a boolean here. On the `tenantSummary` objects embedded in other resources it is always omitted, leaving `"capabilities": {}`.

Use `nicocli tenant-account list` instead.
</Warning>

## Instance Types

Instance types define hardware classes -- they map a named category (like "GB200-NVL72" or "DGX-H100") to a set of physical machines with specific GPU, CPU, and network configurations. Before a tenant can create compute allocations, the instance types must exist and machines must be associated with them.

### How Instance Types Map to Hardware

Each instance type record includes:

- A name identifying the hardware class (e.g., `GB200-NVL72`)
- GPU count and type metadata
- Machine associations linking specific physical machines to the type

The site administrator defines instance types during Day Zero. NICo validates that machines associated with an instance type have compatible hardware before accepting the association.

### Viewing Instance Types

```bash
nicocli instance-type list --output table
```

The TUI provides richer detail:

```bash
nicocli tui
> instance-type list
> instance-type get
```

The detail view for an instance type includes an `allocationStats` section showing how many machines are assigned, allocated, and available (`maxAllocatable`). This tells you the upper bound for a new allocation's constraint value.

### Creating Instance Types (Provider Admin, gRPC Only)

Instance type creation is a gRPC operation via nico-admin-cli:

```bash
nico-admin-cli -a <core-api-url> instance-type create --name "GB200-NVL72" --gpu-count 72
nico-admin-cli -a <core-api-url> instance-type associate --instance-type-id <id> --machine-id <machine-id>
```

See the Quick Start Guide, Step 7 for nico-admin-cli access patterns. The REST API exposes instance type CRUD endpoints, but machine association management is currently gRPC-only.

## Assigning Resources with Allocations

An allocation grants a tenant access to infrastructure at a specific site. Without at least one allocation, a tenant cannot create instances, VPCs, VPC Prefixes, or Subnets. Allocations are provider-side operations requiring the Provider Admin role.

### Allocation Model

Each allocation ties together an infrastructure provider, a tenant, and a site, with exactly one allocation constraint that specifies:

| Resource Type | What It Controls | Constraint Value Meaning |
|--------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| `InstanceType` | Compute (bare-metal machines) | Number of machines of that instance type the tenant may use |
| `IPBlock` | Network (IP address space) | IPv4 prefix length of the sub-block carved from the parent IP block |

The only constraint type currently supported is `Reserved`, which guarantees the specified capacity. The API validator also accepts `OnDemand` and `Preemptible`, but these are not implemented end-to-end.

An allocation starts in `Pending` status, transitions to `Registered` once processed, and can move to `Error` or `Deleting`. The allocation name must be unique per tenant per site.

### Creating a Compute Allocation

Using the TUI (recommended):

```bash
nicocli tui
> allocation create
```

The TUI prompts in this order:

1. **Site** -- select from discovered sites
2. **Allocation name** -- a unique name for this allocation
3. **Description** -- optional
4. **Tenant** -- select from tenant accounts, your own org (shown as "self"), or enter a UUID manually
5. **Resource type** -- `InstanceType` or `IPBlock`
6. **Instance Type** -- scoped to the selected site so you only see valid types
7. **Constraint type** -- `Reserved`
8. **Constraint value** -- machine count (e.g., 8)

Non-interactive:

```bash
nicocli allocation create --data-file - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "acme-gpu-pool",
  "description": "GB200 allocation for Acme Corp",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-uuid>",
  "siteId": "<site-uuid>",
  "allocationConstraints": [
    {
      "resourceType": "InstanceType",
      "resourceTypeId": "<instance-type-uuid>",
      "constraintType": "Reserved",
      "constraintValue": 8
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

The system validates that enough machines of the specified instance type are available before accepting the allocation.

### Creating a Network Allocation

```bash
nicocli allocation create --data-file - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "acme-network",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-uuid>",
  "siteId": "<site-uuid>",
  "allocationConstraints": [
    {
      "resourceType": "IPBlock",
      "resourceTypeId": "<ip-block-uuid>",
      "constraintType": "Reserved",
      "constraintValue": 24
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

A `constraintValue` of 24 allocates a /24 sub-block (256 addresses). The value must be between 1 and 32 and must be greater than or equal to the parent block's prefix length.

### Listing and Inspecting Allocations

```bash
nicocli allocation list --output table
nicocli allocation get <allocation-id>
```

`allocation list` supports rich filter flags (verified via `--help`): `--site-id`, `--tenant-id`, `--infrastructure-provider-id`, `--resource-type` (`InstanceType` or `IPBlock`), `--resource-type-id`, `--status`, `--constraint-type`, `--constraint-value`. The `--query` flag is a free-text search over name/description/status, NOT a key-value filter -- use the dedicated flags instead.

```bash
nicocli allocation list --resource-type InstanceType
nicocli allocation list --site-id <site-uuid> --tenant-id <tenant-uuid>
nicocli allocation list --status Registered --output table
```

TUI equivalents: `allocation list`, `allocation get`. The list-table output prints a one-line pagination summary on stderr (e.g. `Page 1/18 (5 items, 88 total). Use --all to fetch everything.`); `--all` follows pagination for you.

Example allocation detail (IPBlock allocation, /28 reservation against a /16 pool):

```json
{
  "allocationConstraints": [{
    "ResourceTypeID": "<ip-block-uuid>",
    "allocationId": "<allocation-uuid>",
    "constraintType": "Reserved",
    "constraintValue": 28,
    "derivedResourceId": "<derived-block-uuid>",
    "id": "<constraint-uuid>",
    "ipBlock": {
      "id": "<ip-block-uuid>",
      "name": "site-ipv4-pool",
      "prefix": "10.99.0.0",
      "prefixLength": 16,
      "routingType": "Public",
      "status": "Ready"
    },
    "resourceType": "IPBlock"
  }],
  "id": "<allocation-uuid>",
  "infrastructureProviderId": "<provider-uuid>",
  "name": "acme-network",
  "siteId": "<site-uuid>",
  "status": "Registered",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-uuid>"
}
```

`derivedResourceId` is the ID of the sub-resource carved from the parent (the actual sub-block for IP allocations). `ResourceTypeID` is mixed-case in the response -- field name is what the JSON API returns.

### Modifying Allocation Constraints

Adjust an existing constraint value (e.g., increase a machine quota). Note the flag-first ordering with two positionals:

```bash
nicocli allocation constraint update --constraint-value 12 <allocation-id> <constraint-id>
```

Or with `--data`:

```bash
nicocli allocation constraint update --data '{"constraintValue": 12}' <allocation-id> <constraint-id>
```

The system validates:

- **Increases**: Enough machines must be available to support the new total.
- **Decreases**: The new total cannot fall below the tenant's active instance count for that instance type. If the tenant has 6 running instances and you reduce to 4, the request is rejected.

### Deleting an Allocation

```bash
nicocli allocation delete <allocation-id>
```

Deletion is blocked if the tenant has active instances, VPC Prefixes, or Subnets consuming resources from the allocation. Terminate dependent resources first.

### Multiple Allocations per Tenant

A tenant can have multiple allocations at the same site with different resource types or instance types. The aggregate compute quota for a given instance type is the sum of all allocation constraints for that type across the tenant's allocations at that site.

### Allocation Workflow Summary

1. **Provision the tenant** -- `nicocli tenant current`
2. **Establish a tenant account** -- Provider admin links provider to tenant org
3. **Discover available resources** -- List sites, instance types, and IP blocks
4. **Create compute allocation(s)** -- One per instance type the tenant needs
5. **Create network allocation(s)** -- One per IP block the tenant needs
6. **Verify** -- List allocations and confirm they reach `Registered` status

## Creating VPCs and Tenant Networks

After allocations are in place, the tenant can create VPCs and their tenant
network resources within the allocated boundaries. The VPC's
`networkVirtualizationType` determines the resource: `FNN` VPCs use VPC
Prefixes, while `ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER` VPCs use IPv4 Subnets.

### VPC Creation

A VPC is the logical network container for tenant workloads. It defines the
tenant boundary for networking and provides the parent context for VPC
Prefixes or Subnets and instances.

`nicocli vpc create --help` shows these flags:

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `--name` | yes | Unique within the tenant |
| `--site-id` | yes | The site this VPC belongs to |
| `--routing-profile` | no | One of `external`, `internal`, `privileged-internal` (REST API mapping); see core docs for semantics |
| `--network-virtualization-type` | no | `FNN` for VPC Prefixes, `ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER` for IPv4 Subnets, or `FLAT` for zero-DPU and NIC-mode hosts |
| `--nv-link-logical-partition-id` | no | Attach to a specific NVLink partition (GB200) |
| `--vni` | no | Pin a specific VXLAN Network Identifier |
| `--description` | no | |

Realistic non-interactive form:

```bash
nicocli vpc create \
  --name acme-prod \
  --site-id <site-uuid> \
  --routing-profile internal \
  --network-virtualization-type FNN
```

`FNN` is the supported target for production deployments with DPUs. See
[VPC Routing Profiles](../manuals/vpc/vpc_routing_profiles.md) for the support
boundary and [Flat VPCs for Zero-DPU and NIC-Mode Hosts](../manuals/vpc/flat_vpcs_zero_dpu.md)
for the `FLAT` workflow.

TUI flow (prompts in order):

```bash
nicocli tui
> vpc create
```

1. **Site** -- select the site
2. **VPC name** -- unique name
3. **Description** -- optional

The specialized TUI does not prompt for `networkVirtualizationType`; it uses
the Site default. Use the non-interactive command when the VPC type must be
selected explicitly.

Verify the VPC reaches `Ready` status:

```bash
nicocli vpc list --output table
```

> **Routing profiles** govern which VPCs can exchange routes with which others. The REST API accepts `external`, `internal`, and `privileged-internal`; the underlying gRPC API supports any profile defined under `fnn.routing_profiles` in the API server config. For details, see [VPC Routing Profiles](../manuals/vpc/vpc_routing_profiles.md). For the full networking architecture (VRFs, VNI pools, BGP, deny prefixes), see [VPC Network Virtualization](../manuals/vpc/vpc_network_virtualization.md).

### VPC Prefix Creation for FNN

An `FNN` VPC uses a VPC Prefix carved from a tenant IP Block. Create the VPC
Prefix after the parent VPC reaches `Ready`:

```bash
nicocli vpc-prefix create \
  --name acme-prefix-1 \
  --vpc-id <fnn-vpc-uuid> \
  --ip-block-id <ip-block-uuid> \
  --prefix-length 28
```

For the supported IPv4 creation path, `--prefix-length` accepts 8 through 31
and must be greater than the selected parent IP Block's prefix length. REST
support for creating IPv6 FNN VPC Prefixes is tracked by
[#5407](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/5407).

### IPv4 Subnet Creation for ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER

A Subnet is an IPv4 range within an `ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER` VPC, carved from a
Ready tenant IPv4 IP Block at the same Site. Subnets do not support IPv6; FNN
VPCs use VPC Prefixes instead.

`nicocli subnet create --help` shows these flags. Note the flag name
`--ipv4block-id`, with no separator between `v4` and `block`:

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `--name` | yes | |
| `--vpc-id` | yes | Ready `ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER` VPC |
| `--prefix-length` | yes | IPv4 prefix length from 8 through 30 |
| `--ipv4block-id` | yes | Ready tenant IPv4 IP Block at the VPC's Site |
| `--description` | no | |

Non-interactive:

```bash
nicocli subnet create \
  --name acme-subnet-1 \
  --vpc-id <vpc-uuid> \
  --ipv4block-id <ip-block-uuid> \
  --prefix-length 28
```

Or via `--data` (the JSON body uses camelCase even though the flag is single-word):

```bash
nicocli subnet create --data '{"name": "acme-subnet-1", "vpcId": "<vpc-uuid>", "ipv4BlockId": "<ip-block-uuid>", "prefixLength": 28}'
```

TUI flow:

```bash
nicocli tui
> subnet create
```

1. **Ready Ethernet virtualizer VPC** -- select the parent VPC
2. **Subnet name** -- unique name
3. **Description** -- optional
4. **IPv4 prefix length** -- 8 through 30
5. **Tenant IPv4 Block** -- select a Ready tenant IPv4 IP Block at the VPC's Site

Verify:

```bash
nicocli subnet list --output table
```

## Launching an Instance

An instance in NICo is a bare-metal machine assigned to a tenant within a VPC. Creating an instance claims a machine from the tenant's compute allocation, associates it with a VPC, and triggers the provisioning workflow (OS installation, network configuration, security lockdown).

`nicocli instance create --help` shows these flags:

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `--name` | yes | |
| `--tenant-id` | yes | Owning tenant -- often missed in older docs |
| `--vpc-id` | yes | Parent VPC |
| `--machine-id` | no | Pin to a specific machine (requires [targeted instance creation](#granting-targeted-instance-creation) on the tenant's account for that site) |
| `--instance-type-id` | no | Pick from the pool of machines of this type (alternative to `--machine-id`) |
| `--operating-system-id` | no | OS for PXE provisioning; see [Templated iPXE Operating Systems](templated-ipxe-operating-systems.md) |
| `--allow-unhealthy-machine` | no | Override health checks |
| `--ipxe-script` | no | Custom iPXE script |
| `--user-data` | no | cloud-init style user data |
| `--phone-home-enabled` | no | Whether to wait for the OS to phone home for `BootCompleted` |
| `--network-security-group-id` | no | NSG to apply |

`interfaces[]` and `sshKeyGroupIds[]` are array-typed and must go through `--data` / `--data-file`.

Non-interactive form for an `FNN` VPC (with one interface and one SSH key
group):

```bash
nicocli instance create --data-file - <<'EOF'
{
  "name": "acme-worker-01",
  "tenantId": "<tenant-uuid>",
  "vpcId": "<vpc-uuid>",
  "instanceTypeId": "<instance-type-uuid>",
  "interfaces": [
    {"vpcPrefixId": "<vpc-prefix-uuid>"}
  ],
  "sshKeyGroupIds": ["<ssh-key-group-uuid>"]
}
EOF
```

If you want to target a specific machine instead, replace `instanceTypeId` with `machineId`. Machine targeting requires the tenant's account with the site's provider to be `Ready` and to have the capability enabled for that site. Refer to [Granting Targeted Instance Creation](#granting-targeted-instance-creation).

TUI flow:

```bash
nicocli tui
> instance create
```

1. **VPC** -- select the target VPC
2. **Machine** -- select from machines in `Ready` state at the VPC's site
3. **Instance name** -- unique name
4. **Operating system** -- optional
5. **Network resource** -- select a VPC Prefix for `FNN` or a Subnet for
   `ETHERNET_VIRTUALIZER` (loops, can add more). `FLAT` VPCs attach the network
   automatically and skip this prompt.
6. **SSH key groups** -- optional, attaches SSH keys for serial-console access

For an image-based operating system, review [Image-Based Operating Systems](image-based-operating-systems.md) before making the definition available to tenants. Its disk selector applies to every eligible target and the selected whole disk is overwritten during installation.

### Verifying an Instance Is Running

After creation, the instance goes through these states:

```text
Pending -> Ready -> BootCompleted          (initial provisioning, OS up + phone-home)
Pending -> Ready                            (initial provisioning, no phone-home)
Ready -> Configuring -> Ready               (in-place reconfigure: NSG, SSH keys, OS, iPXE, user-data)
Ready -> Rebooting -> Ready -> BootCompleted (during reboot)
Error                                       (if provisioning fails)
```

Two states are easy to miss:

- `BootCompleted` -- follows `Ready` once the OS phones home. Instances without phone-home enabled stop at `Ready`.
- `Configuring` -- the instance transitions through this state when its config is being updated in place (e.g. attaching a new Network Security Group, rotating SSH key groups, swapping the OS image, or pushing new user-data). Configuring does NOT trigger a reboot on its own; the instance returns to `Ready` once the change is applied. A reboot caused by `--trigger-reboot=true` goes through `Rebooting`, not `Configuring`.

Monitor progress:

```bash
nicocli instance list --output table
nicocli instance get <instance-id>
nicocli instance status-history <instance-id>
```

The instance detail response is rich -- it includes `interfaces[]` with assigned IP addresses and VPC prefix info, `ipxeScript` showing the live boot script, `serialConsoleUrl` for console access, full machine and SKU metadata, and any active `deprecations[]` warnings. The API uses inline `deprecations[]` arrays to flag fields scheduled for removal -- watch for these in your responses.

### Phone-home

`phoneHomeEnabled` (`--phone-home-enabled`) controls whether NICo waits for the booted operating system to call back -- to "phone home" -- before it reports the instance as ready. It is a property of the operating-system definition (`operating-system create` / `operating-system update`) and can also be set per instance (`instance create` / `instance update`).

**What it does.** When phone-home is enabled, NICo does not consider the instance fully provisioned until the booted OS contacts NICo's metadata service from inside the guest. The instance is held in a provisioning state -- the transition to `Ready` is gated -- until that callback arrives. When it is disabled, NICo reports the instance ready as soon as provisioning and config sync finish, without waiting for any signal from the OS.

**What NICo injects.** When phone-home is enabled, NICo edits your `userData`. You do not add the callback yourself. NICo parses your cloud-init YAML, removes the existing [`phone_home`](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/modules.html#phone-home) blocks that it can edit, and inserts one that sends a POST request to the site's metadata endpoint:

```yaml
#cloud-config
# ... your first-boot setup (SSH keys, passwords, packages, ...) ...
phone_home:
  post: all
  url: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/phone_home
```

The injected `url` is the site-configured phone-home endpoint in `site.phoneHomeUrl`. The default is `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/phone_home`. The platform operator can override this endpoint for each deployment. If you supply no `userData` when enabling phone-home, NICo generates a minimal `#cloud-config` that contains only the block above.

When you disable phone-home, the removal behavior depends on whether the request supplies `userData`. If it does, NICo removes only a `phone_home` block that reports to the site endpoint and leaves blocks that report elsewhere unchanged. If the request omits `userData`, NICo edits the stored blob. If NICo stored that blob with phone-home enabled, it removes every `phone_home` block. A stored block can contain a URL from before a change to `site.phoneHomeUrl`.

**Which user data NICo can edit.** When phone-home is enabled, the `userData` you provide must be one of these formats:

- A `#cloud-config` mapping.
- A `#cloud-config-archive` sequence.

The API rejects these inputs:

- A `#!` script.
- A `## template: jinja` document, because NICo cannot render the template back to text.
- Another cloud-init format, including `#cloud-boothook` or `#cloud-config-jsonp`.
- More than one YAML document.
- Text that is not YAML.

NICo treats user data without a format marker as `#cloud-config`, including user data with only a comment above the keys. Enabling phone-home writes the marker at the top so that cloud-init reads the document. When you disable phone-home for user data that NICo cannot edit, NICo leaves the document unchanged instead of rejecting the request. Any `phone_home` block in that document remains.

**Where the block lands.** In a `#cloud-config` document, NICo adds the block at the top level. If the document contains an `autoinstall` section, NICo adds the block under `autoinstall.user-data`. This placement makes the callback come from the installed system instead of the installer.

In a `#cloud-config-archive`, NICo adds the block to the part that installs a target system, again under `autoinstall.user-data`. Cloud-init determines a part's format from its `type` without reading the content. If `type` is absent, cloud-init uses the content's first line. If neither value identifies a format, cloud-init treats the part as `cloud-config`. The first-line rule above therefore applies to the document you send, not to the parts inside it.

NICo leaves a part whose content is a `## template: jinja` document unchanged because it cannot render the template back to text. If no part installs a target system, NICo appends a `#cloud-config` part that contains only the block. NICo does the same when the installation part is a template that it leaves unchanged. In both cases, NICo leaves your parts unchanged:

```yaml
#cloud-config-archive
- type: text/x-shellscript
  content: |
    #!/bin/sh
    # ... your part, untouched ...
- type: text/cloud-config
  content: |
    #cloud-config
    phone_home:
      post: all
      url: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/phone_home
```

cloud-init runs the `phone_home` module in its final stage, after the rest of your configuration has been applied, so the callback fires only after your setup has completed. When NICo receives the POST, it records the contact and releases the readiness gate, allowing the instance to become `Ready`.

**When to use it.** Enable phone-home when "ready" must mean "the guest has finished its own first-boot setup" -- for example, to delay readiness until cloud-init has applied SSH keys and passwords, so that automation watching for `Ready` does not connect before the host is fully configured. Leave phone-home disabled when NICo finishing provisioning is a sufficient ready signal and you do not need a callback from inside the guest.

**Notes and caveats.**

- Phone-home only gates *status reporting*. It does not change how the host is provisioned or booted -- the reboot into the provisioned OS happens identically whether or not phone-home is enabled.
- If phone-home is enabled but the booted OS never runs cloud-init, or the guest cannot reach the metadata endpoint, the callback never arrives and the instance stays in its provisioning state, never reporting ready.
- The metadata endpoint (by default, `169.254.169.254`) is not a tenant-facing API, and is reachable only from the provisioned host over its link-local metadata link.
- Rebooting the instance with a one-time custom iPXE override (`instance update --reboot-with-custom-ipxe=true`) re-arms the gate when phone-home is enabled: NICo clears the recorded contact, so the OS must phone home again before the instance is reported ready.

### Batch Instance Creation

For creating multiple identical instances at once, use `instance batch-create`. Unlike `create`, batch-create takes a single shared spec plus a count -- it provisions N instances with auto-generated names from the same instance type, tenant, and VPC. `nicocli instance batch-create --help` shows:

| Flag | Required | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `--name-prefix` | yes | Prefix used to generate per-instance names |
| `--count` | yes | Number of instances to create |
| `--instance-type-id` | yes | Shared across all instances in the batch (machine targeting is not available in batch mode) |
| `--tenant-id` | yes | Owning tenant |
| `--vpc-id` | yes | Parent VPC |
| `--operating-system-id` | no | OS for PXE provisioning |
| `--topology-optimized` | no | Hint to schedule the batch close together on the fabric |
| `--phone-home-enabled`, `--ipxe-script`, `--user-data`, `--network-security-group-id`, `--description`, `--always-boot-with-custom-ipxe` | no | Same semantics as `instance create` |

Non-interactive form:

```bash
nicocli instance batch-create \
  --tenant-id <tenant-uuid> \
  --vpc-id <vpc-uuid> \
  --instance-type-id <instance-type-uuid> \
  --name-prefix acme-worker \
  --count 4 \
  --topology-optimized=true
```

`interfaces[]` and `sshKeyGroupIds[]` are still array-typed and must go through `--data` / `--data-file` if you need to attach them at create time.

For batches where each instance needs a different machine ID, OS, or interface set, call `instance create` in a loop instead -- batch-create only handles the homogeneous case.

## Instance Power Management

NICo provides instance-level power management through the REST API. These operations send commands to the underlying BMC via Redfish.

### Rebooting an Instance

`nicocli instance update --help` exposes individual flags for every common operation -- prefer them over `--data`:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--trigger-reboot=true` | Issue a reboot via BMC |
| `--reboot-with-custom-ipxe=true` | One-time iPXE boot override (for re-provisioning) |
| `--apply-updates-on-reboot=true` | Apply queued firmware/config updates as part of the reboot |
| `--always-boot-with-custom-ipxe=true` | Persist custom iPXE on every boot |
| `--name=<new>` | Rename the instance |
| `--description=<text>` | Update description |
| `--operating-system-id=<uuid>` | Change OS |
| `--ipxe-script=<text>` | Set a custom iPXE script body |
| `--user-data=<text>` | Update cloud-init user-data |
| `--phone-home-enabled=<bool>` | Toggle BootCompleted tracking |
| `--network-security-group-id=<uuid>` | Apply or change NSG |

Reboot:

```bash
nicocli instance update --trigger-reboot=true <instance-id>
```

Reboot with re-provisioning iPXE and pending updates:

```bash
nicocli instance update --trigger-reboot=true --reboot-with-custom-ipxe=true --apply-updates-on-reboot=true <instance-id>
```

TUI:

```bash
nicocli tui
> instance reboot
```

The TUI prompts for instance, custom-iPXE flag, apply-updates flag, and a confirmation.

### Renaming or Updating an Instance

```bash
nicocli instance update --name acme-worker-01-renamed <instance-id>
nicocli instance update --description "production worker" <instance-id>
```

`sshKeyGroupIds[]` is an array, so changes go through the body:

```bash
nicocli instance update --data '{"sshKeyGroupIds": ["<group-uuid-1>", "<group-uuid-2>"]}' <instance-id>
```

### Deleting (Terminating) an Instance

```bash
nicocli instance delete <instance-id>
```

In TUI mode, `instance delete` prompts for confirmation before proceeding. Deletion triggers the full sanitization workflow: secure erase of NVMe storage, GPU and system memory wipe, TPM reset, re-attestation, and network isolation teardown. The machine returns to the available pool once sanitization completes.

### Machine-Level Emergency Operations (gRPC Only)

For stuck or unresponsive machines that cannot be managed through the instance API, nico-admin-cli provides direct BMC operations:

```bash
# Force-reboot via BMC
nico-admin-cli -a <core-api-url> machine reboot --machine-id="<machine-id>"

# Force-delete a stuck machine (destructive -- wipes machine state)
nico-admin-cli -a <core-api-url> machine force-delete --machine="<machine-id>"
```

See the [Machine Reboot](../playbooks/machine_reboot.md) and [Force Delete](../playbooks/force_delete.md) playbooks in the core documentation for detailed procedures.

## Tenant Lifecycle Operations

### Viewing the Current Tenant

```bash
nicocli tenant current
```

For provider admins needing visibility across tenants, list tenant accounts (a filter flag is required):

```bash
nicocli tenant-account list --infrastructure-provider-id <provider-uuid> --output table
```

### Monitoring Tenant Health

```bash
nicocli tenant stats
```

Non-zero `error` counts warrant investigation:

```bash
nicocli instance list --status error --output table
```

Provider admins can get cross-tenant compute allocation stats at a site. `instance-type-stats` is a sub-resource of `tenant`, with a `stats` leaf action -- the full command has three tokens:

```bash
nicocli tenant instance-type-stats stats --site-id <site-uuid>
```

A bare `nicocli tenant instance-type-stats --site-id <id>` returns `flag provided but not defined: -site-id` -- the trailing `stats` is required.

### Disabling a Tenant

NICo has no first-class "disable" operation. Options:

- **Revoke identity provider roles**: Remove `TENANT_ADMIN` from all users. Existing resources remain but cannot be managed.
- **Remove allocations**: Delete all allocations. Existing instances continue running but no new ones can be created.
- **Delete the tenant account**: Sever the provider-tenant relationship entirely (requires all allocations deleted first).

### Tenant Teardown Sequence

There is no `DELETE /tenant` endpoint -- tenant records are permanent. To fully decommission:

1. **Terminate all instances** -- delete every instance; each must reach `Terminated` status.
2. **Delete all tenant network resources** -- remove VPC Prefixes or Subnets
   from every VPC, according to its `networkVirtualizationType`.
3. **Delete all VPCs** -- remove the tenant's VPCs.
4. **Delete all allocations** -- provider admin removes compute and network allocations.
5. **Delete the tenant account** -- provider admin severs the link.
6. **Revoke identity provider access** -- remove roles and optionally org membership.

After this sequence, the tenant record still exists but is inert.

> This teardown is destructive and irreversible at the resource level. Terminated instances cannot be recovered. Always confirm with the tenant team before beginning.

## End-to-End Walkthrough

This section ties together the full Day One workflow. The TUI flow is the recommended path for first-time operators -- it scopes lookups (instance types to sites, VPC prefixes to VPCs, etc.) and you can't easily get the order wrong.

### Step 1: Provision the Tenant (Tenant Admin)

```bash
nicocli tenant current
```

Idempotent -- creates the tenant lazily on first call.

### Step 2: Establish Tenant Account (Provider Admin)

```bash
nicocli tenant-account create --infrastructure-provider-id <provider-uuid> --tenant-org <tenant-org>
```

Or via TUI: `tenant-account create`.

### Step 3: Accept Tenant Account (Tenant Admin)

```bash
# Find the invitation
nicocli tenant-account list --tenant-id <tenant-uuid>

# Accept it
nicocli tenant-account update --data '{}' <account-id>
```

### Step 4: Create Compute Allocation (Provider Admin)

Use the TUI for the first one -- it filters instance types by the selected site and validates capacity:

```bash
nicocli tui
> allocation create
# Site -> name -> tenant -> InstanceType -> select type -> Reserved -> machine count
```

### Step 5: Create Network Allocation (Provider Admin)

```bash
nicocli tui
> allocation create
# Same site -> name -> tenant -> IPBlock -> select block -> Reserved -> prefix length
```

### Step 6: Verify Allocations

```bash
nicocli allocation list --output table --tenant-id <tenant-uuid>
```

All allocations should show `Registered` status.

### Step 7: Create an FNN VPC (Tenant Admin)

```bash
nicocli vpc create --name <n> --site-id <site-uuid> --routing-profile internal --network-virtualization-type FNN
```

### Step 8: Create a VPC Prefix (Tenant Admin)

```bash
nicocli vpc-prefix create --name <n> --vpc-id <vpc-uuid> --ip-block-id <ip-block-uuid> --prefix-length 28
```

### Step 9: Launch an Instance (Tenant Admin)

The first instance is easiest via TUI because `interfaces[]` is array-typed:

```bash
nicocli tui
> instance create
# VPC -> Machine -> name -> OS (optional) -> VPC prefix -> SSH key groups (optional)
```

For automation, use `--data-file` -- see the Launching an Instance section above.

### Step 10: Verify

```bash
nicocli tenant stats
nicocli instance list --output table
nicocli instance status-history <instance-id>
```

The instance should reach `Ready` (or `BootCompleted` if `phoneHomeEnabled: true`). Tenant stats should now show non-zero counts for `instance` and `vpc`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Resolution |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| HTTP 404 "The requested path could not be found" on every command | `api.name` in your config does not match the deployment | See the nicocli reference guide for how to find the deployment's expected `api.name` and update your config |
| HTTP 401 "Request is missing authorization header" | No bearer token cached | Run `nicocli login` (or for SSA deployments, run your token-fetch script and set `auth.token` / `auth.token_command`) |
| HTTP 401 on previously-working session | Token expired | If using OIDC or token-command, nicocli auto-refreshes; if using a static `auth.token`, mint a new token |
| `No help topic for 'get-current-user'` | Command name wrong; CLI generates `user get`, not `user get-current-user` | Use `nicocli user get` |
| `flag(s) --foo placed after a positional argument` | Flags placed AFTER positional args | Move all flags before positionals (`update --name X <id>`, not `update <id> --name X`) |
| HTTP 400 on `tenant-account list` "Either infrastructureProviderId or tenantId..." | Missing required filter | Add `--tenant-id <id>` or `--infrastructure-provider-id <id>` |
| HTTP 403 "Failed to validate membership for org" | User is not a member of the configured org | Verify `api.org` in config matches your IdP org; confirm membership |
| HTTP 403 "User does not have Tenant Admin role" | Missing role assignment | Have an admin in your IdP assign the role |
| HTTP 400 on allocation create "machines available" | Not enough capacity at the site | Check `nicocli instance-type get <id>` for `allocationStats.maxAllocatable` |
| HTTP 400 on allocation constraint update with shrink | New value < tenant's active instance count for that type | Terminate instances first, then resize |
| Instance stuck in `Pending` or `Registering` | Provisioning workflow blocked or failed | `nicocli instance status-history <id>` for the failure message |
| Connection refused on `localhost:8388` | Port-forward died | Re-run `kubectl port-forward -n nico-rest svc/nico-rest-api 8388:http` (note the service port name is `http`, not 8388) |

### Debugging with nicocli

Use `--debug` on any command to see the full HTTP request and response. The token is redacted in the log; the path-rewriting from `nico` to whatever `api.name` is set to is visible. Real output:

```bash
$ nicocli --debug tenant current
time=... msg="API request: GET http://<api>/v2/org/<org>/<api-name>/tenant/current"
time=... msg="Request headers: {\"Accept\":[\"application/json\"],\"Authorization\":[\"Bearer <redacted>\"]}"
time=... msg="API response: ... -> 200 OK"
time=... msg="Response body: {...}"
```

### Version mismatch is normal

The CLI version and the API server version are independent. CLI is generated from the OpenAPI spec at the time of build; the server reports its own image version (visible in audit response `apiVersion` field). Different versions are expected -- the wire protocol is stable enough that mismatches rarely matter.

### Audit log

The list view is intentionally lightweight -- each entry has `id`, `endpoint`, `method`, `statusCode`, `userId`, `clientIP`, `apiVersion`, and `timestamp`. To see the full request, including the request body and the resolved user object, fetch a single entry:

```bash
nicocli audit list --output json --page-size 5      # find entries of interest
nicocli audit get <audit-id>                         # fetch full detail
```

`audit get` adds `body`, `queryParams`, `extraData`, `durationMs`, `statusMessage`, and the resolved `user` (with email and name when the caller was a human, blanks when the caller was a service account). The table form of `audit list` only shows `id` -- always use `--output json` (or `audit get`) for anything more than ID discovery.

### Using the TUI for Exploration

The TUI is the recommended tool for exploratory work. It handles config selection, authentication, and provides tab-complete interactive commands:

```bash
nicocli tui
```

The TUI discovers all `config*.yaml` files in `~/.nico/` and lets you pick an environment at startup. Commands like `allocation create` scope lookups to the relevant site automatically, reducing the chance of selecting a resource from the wrong site.
