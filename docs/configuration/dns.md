# DNS <Badge intent="info">v2.0</Badge> <Badge intent="launch" minimal>New</Badge>

NICo answers DNS for everything it manages. Records are never authored by hand: they derive from the machine, BMC, and instance inventory in the `nico-api` database, appear when an interface or instance gains an address, and disappear when it loses one. This page covers the names NICo serves, how the site zone and per-segment subdomains are configured, and how reverse (PTR) resolution works. For the deployment side - the `nico-dns` service, the recursive resolver in front of it, and the fixed infrastructure service names - refer to [IP and Network Configuration](../provisioning/ip-and-network-configuration.md#3-dns-configuration).

## What Gets a Name

Every managed machine interface gets a hostname; [Host Naming](host-naming.md) covers how that label is chosen. These are the forward records NICo serves:

| Name | Answers for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<hostname>.<domain>` | A host's primary interface and every BMC interface | The human-facing name, built by the host-naming strategy |
| `<machine-id>.adm.<domain>` | A host's primary interface | Keyed on the stable machine id |
| `<machine-id>.bmc.<domain>` | A machine's BMC interface | Host, predicted-host, and DPU machine ids |
| `<ip-hostname>.<segment subdomain>` | An overlay (DPU-managed) instance address | Always IP-derived (`10-1-2-3`, or the fully expanded IPv6 form), independent of the host-naming strategy |

Records serve as A or AAAA per address family, with a 300-second TTL by default. An interface that loses all of its addresses drops out of DNS until it has one again. Instances on `host_inband` segments publish no instance record: their address is the host's own interface address, which the machine records above already serve.

## The Site Zone and Segment Subdomains

The site's forward zone is seeded once, at first startup, from the `nico-api` config:

```toml
initial_domain_name = "mysite.example.com"
```

The domain is created only when no domain exists yet, and most sites use a single domain for their lifetime. Network segments then decide which of their interfaces and instances get names:

- Segments seeded from the config (`[networks.*]`) inherit the site domain automatically.
- Segments created later through the API or CLI name their subdomain explicitly: `nico-admin-cli network-segment create ... --subdomain-id <domain-id>` (required for `host-inband` segments; list domains with `nico-admin-cli domain show`).
- A segment with no subdomain produces no DNS at all: its interfaces and instances have no zone to live in.

## Reverse DNS

Reverse resolution mirrors the forward records that matter to humans:

- An address on a primary interface or a BMC interface answers PTR with `<hostname>.<domain>`.
- An overlay instance address answers PTR with its instance name.
- The `adm` and `bmc` machine-id forms are forward-only.

Reverse zones are derived, not managed. When a network segment is created, NICo derives the matching `in-addr.arpa` / `ip6.arpa` zone from each of its prefixes (for example, `192.0.2.0/24` becomes `2.0.192.in-addr.arpa`) and removes it again when the segment is deleted. Only octet-aligned IPv4 prefixes (/8, /16, /24, /32) and nibble-aligned IPv6 prefixes get a zone; anything else is skipped, since RFC 2317 classless delegation is out of scope. PTR answers themselves are matched by address, so alignment never blocks an answer; the derived zone rows define which reverse zones you delegate.

Like the forward zone, reverse zones must be delegated from your upstream DNS - or forwarded by your recursive resolver - to the `nico-dns` service address. NICo creates the zones but cannot delegate them for you.

## Server Behavior Worth Knowing

- `nico-dns` answers A, AAAA, and PTR queries only; every other type answers "not implemented". It never recurses, and it serves no SOA or NS records and no zone transfers, so put it behind your recursive resolver (a forward zone works best) rather than in a client's resolver list.
- Answers reflect the database live: there is no positive cache and no zone-serial machinery. A record change is visible on the next query.
- A name that exists with only the other address family answers NXDomain rather than an empty answer, and negative answers are cached at the edge briefly (120 seconds by default).
- Hosts learn their own FQDN over DHCP option 12 on every path; hosts served by a DPU also receive it as DHCP option 15.

## Resolvers Handed to Hosts

DHCP option 6 tells managed machines where to resolve, and it must point at the recursive resolver, never at `nico-dns` directly (`nico-dns` cannot answer external names or the infrastructure service names):

- On the site DHCP path, option 6 comes from the `nico-dhcp` Kea hook parameter `carbide-nameservers` (the `config.kea.hookParameters.nameservers` Helm value emits it).
- Hosts behind a DPU receive the DPU's own resolver set.
- The IPv6 side (DHCPv6 option 23) is implemented in the hook, but no DHCPv6 server ships yet, so IPv6 resolver advertisement is inert today.

## Troubleshooting

The following table lists common situations and where to look:

| Symptom | Likely cause / action |
|---|---|
| A machine interface has no name | Only primary and BMC interfaces publish records; the interface can also be addressless, or its segment can lack a subdomain. `nico-admin-cli managed-host show <machine-id>` shows interfaces and the primary flag; the `/admin/ipam/dns` web page lists every record NICo is serving. |
| An instance has no name | The segment's `--subdomain-id` is unset, the address predates instance-hostname population (records populate for addresses allocated going forward), or the instance is on a `host_inband` segment (the host's machine record serves that address). |
| PTR is missing while the forward name resolves | Only the `<hostname>.<domain>` and instance forms answer PTR; the `adm` and `bmc` machine-id forms are forward-only. |
| Hosts cannot resolve external names | DHCP option 6 points at `nico-dns` (authoritative only) instead of the recursive resolver. Refer to [IP and Network Configuration](../provisioning/ip-and-network-configuration.md#32-unbound-recursive-resolver-for-managed-machines). |
