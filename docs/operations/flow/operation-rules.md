# Operation Rules <Badge intent="info">v2.2</Badge> <Badge intent="launch" minimal>New</Badge>

User-defined operation rules configure power control and firmware operations. Each rule specifies a sequence of steps that determine
component ordering, parallelism, verification, and retry behavior.

## Concepts

### Rules and Operations

Each rule is bound to a single **operation** (e.g., `power_on`, `power_off`).
When an operation is triggered, Flow resolves the applicable rule for the target
rack and executes it.

### Steps and Stages

A rule contains **steps**. Each step targets one component type and belongs to
a numbered **stage**. Execution proceeds stage by stage in ascending order.
Within a stage, all steps run in parallel.

```text
Stage 1: [powershelf step]
Stage 2: [nvswitch step]
Stage 3: [compute step]        ← stages are sequential
         [nvswitch step]      ← steps within a stage are parallel
```

### Action Sequences

Each step defines optional `pre_operation` and `post_operation` lists and one required `main_operation` action:

- `pre_operation` — runs before the main operation (e.g., Sleep to settle)
- `main_operation` — the primary work (PowerControl, FirmwareControl, or a
  verification action when used as the entire step's purpose)
- `post_operation` — runs after the main operation (e.g., verify status)

All three phases execute inside a single child workflow per component-type step. The step supplies activity timeout and retry defaults; Flow derives a separate child-workflow execution budget.

## Rule Schema

### Top-level fields

Rules are submitted as JSON via the `--rule-file` flag or embedded in a YAML
batch file.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [ ... ]
}
```

| Field     | Type     | Required | Description                        |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------------------------------|
| `version` | string   | no       | Schema version. Omission or an empty string selects `"v1"`; other versions are rejected on read and write. |
| `steps` | array | no | Omission or an empty array is accepted. Define steps explicitly for a custom sequence. |

### Step fields

| Field           | Type     | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `component_type`| string   | yes      | Component this step targets: `"Compute"`, `"NVSwitch"`, `"PowerShelf"`, `"ToRSwitch"`, `"UMS"`, or `"CDU"` (case-insensitive) |
| `stage`         | integer  | yes      | Execution order. Steps with the same stage run in parallel. Must be ≥ 1 |
| `max_parallel`  | integer  | no      | Max concurrent components. Defaults to `0` (unlimited); `1` = sequential; negative values are rejected |
| `timeout`       | duration | no       | Base activity start-to-close timeout; omission or zero uses 20 minutes. Also contributes to the derived child-workflow budget. |
| `retry`         | object   | no       | Activity retry defaults; omission uses 3 attempts, 1s initial interval, twofold backoff, and 1m maximum interval |
| `pre_operation` | array    | no       | Actions to run before `main_operation` |
| `main_operation`| object   | yes      | The primary action |
| `post_operation`| array    | no       | Actions to run after `main_operation` |

The validator accepts all six component types. The service only registers
component managers for Compute, NVSwitch, and PowerShelf; accepting a rule
does not establish runtime support for ToRSwitch, UMS, or CDU. Execution also
requires the selected manager to support each action.

`max_parallel` partitions batchable component actions into sequential batches. All
batches of an action finish before the next action starts. Each `Sleep` action
runs once, not once per batch. `VerifyReachability` runs once but batches its
status requests. This limit is per step, not rack-wide; steps in the same stage
still run in parallel. See [Operation Rule Execution](../../development/flow/operation-rule-execution.md)
for internal action scopes and replay compatibility.

### Retry policy fields

| Field                | Type    | Required | Description |
|----------------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| `max_attempts`       | integer | yes      | Total attempts including the first. Must be ≥ 1 |
| `initial_interval`   | duration| yes      | Wait before first retry. E.g. `"5s"` |
| `backoff_coefficient`| float   | yes      | Multiplier for each subsequent interval. Must be ≥ 1.0 |
| `max_interval`       | duration| no       | Cap on retry interval. E.g. `"1m"` |

### Duration format

All duration fields accept Go duration strings: `"5s"`, `"30s"`, `"2m"`,
`"1m30s"`, `"10m"`, `"1h"`.

## Actions Reference

The user-rule validator rejects `BringUpControl`, `WaitBringUp`, and `InjectExpectation`. Their presence in internal workflows does not make them accepted user-rule actions. The public operation-rule API exposes power-control and firmware-control operation types.

### PowerControl

Executes a power operation (on/off/restart) for the component.

When used from the power workflow, the operation is inherited from the task
context — no parameters required. When used cross-workflow (e.g., firmware
power recycle, bring-up), specify `operation` explicitly:

```yaml
# Within a power workflow (inherits from task):
main_operation:
  name: PowerControl

# Cross-workflow usage (explicit operation):
main_operation:
  name: PowerControl
  parameters:
    operation: "force_power_off"
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | no       | Overrides step timeout for this action only |

| Parameter   | Required | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| `operation` | no*      | Power operation code. Required when used outside a power workflow. Valid values: `power_on`, `force_power_on`, `power_off`, `force_power_off`, `restart`, `force_restart`, `warm_reset`, `cold_reset` |

### FirmwareControl

Starts a firmware update and polls for completion (async start + poll pattern).
Calls `FirmwareControl` to initiate, then repeatedly calls
`GetFirmwareStatus` until all components complete or the poll timeout
expires.

```yaml
main_operation:
  name: FirmwareControl
  parameters:
    poll_interval: 2m    # time between status polls (default: 2m)
    poll_timeout: 30m    # max wait for completion (default: 30m)
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | no       | Overrides step timeout for this action only |

| Parameter       | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `poll_interval` | no       | Time between status polls (default `2m`) |
| `poll_timeout`  | no       | Max time to wait for completion (default `30m`) |

### VerifyPowerStatus

Polls the component until its power status matches `expected_status`. Typically
used in `post_operation` to confirm the result of `PowerControl`.

```json
{
  "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
  "timeout": "30s",
  "poll_interval": "5s",
  "parameters": {
    "expected_status": "on"
  }
}
```

| Field           | Required | Description |
|-----------------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout`       | yes      | Maximum time to wait for status to match |
| `poll_interval` | yes      | How often to check status |
| `expected_status` (param) | yes | `"on"` or `"off"` |

When used as `main_operation`, the step performs only verification (no power
command is sent). This is the pattern for forceful operation final-verification
stages.

### VerifyReachability

Polls until all components of the specified types in the rack become reachable
over the network. Used after powering on a powershelf to confirm downstream
components have booted, or before bring-up to wait for all PMCs.

By default, a component type is considered reachable when the `GetPowerStatus`
API call succeeds. With `require_all: true`, every individual component within
the type must respond (i.e., the returned status map must contain all target
component IDs).

```yaml
# Basic reachability (API call succeeds):
- name: VerifyReachability
  timeout: 3m
  poll_interval: 10s
  parameters:
    component_types: ["compute", "nvswitch"]

# Strict mode (every individual component must respond):
- name: VerifyReachability
  timeout: 10m
  poll_interval: 30s
  parameters:
    component_types: ["powershelf"]
    require_all: true
```

| Field              | Required | Description |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout`          | yes      | Maximum time to wait |
| `poll_interval`    | yes      | How often to probe |

| Parameter          | Required | Description |
|--------------------|----------|-------------|
| `component_types`  | yes      | Array of component type strings to check |
| `require_all`      | no       | When `true`, every individual component must respond (default `false`) |

### Sleep

Pauses execution for a fixed duration. Implemented as a durable workflow timer
(survives worker restarts). Useful for hardware settle time.

```json
{
  "name": "Sleep",
  "parameters": {
    "duration": "30s"
  }
}
```

| Field        | Required | Description |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| `duration` (param) | yes | How long to sleep. E.g. `"30s"`, `"2m"` |

### GetPowerStatus

Queries the current power status of components and returns a status map.

```json
{
  "name": "GetPowerStatus",
  "timeout": "30s"
}
```

| Field     | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `timeout` | yes      | Maximum time for the query |

### DecommissionControl

Requests decommissioning of the target components. It has no required
parameters. The executor uses a five-minute activity timeout and one attempt,
overriding the step's activity timeout and retry settings. Completion of this
action confirms the request, not that decommissioning has finished.

### WaitDecommissioned

Polls decommission status until every target reports `Decommissioned` or
`Decommissioning/Decommissioned`. Use it after `DecommissionControl` to wait
for completion.

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `timeout` | yes | Overall polling deadline, as a Go duration string. Zero or omission is rejected. |
| `poll_interval` | yes | Delay between status calls, as a Go duration string. Zero or omission is rejected. |

Use positive durations. `Ready`, `Maintenance(...)`, and other
`Decommissioning/` states continue polling. Missing or empty status results,
unexpected states, five minutes of consecutive status-call failures, or the
action deadline cause failure. Both decommission actions require the selected
component manager's decommission capabilities; schema validation alone does
not check those capabilities.

## Examples

### Graceful power on

Powers components in dependency order (powershelf → nvswitch → compute) and
verifies status at each stage before proceeding.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 1,
      "max_parallel": 1,

      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0,
        "max_interval": "1m"
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        },
        {
          "name": "VerifyReachability",
          "timeout": "3m",
          "poll_interval": "10s",
          "parameters": { "component_types": ["compute", "nvswitch"] }
        },
        {
          "name": "Sleep",
          "parameters": { "duration": "30s" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "nvswitch",
      "stage": 2,
      "max_parallel": 4,
      "timeout": "15m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0,
        "max_interval": "1m"
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "compute",
      "stage": 3,
      "max_parallel": 8,
      "timeout": "20m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",

      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",

          "parameters": { "expected_status": "on" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Graceful power off

Reverse dependency order (compute → nvswitch → powershelf). A `Sleep` in the
powershelf `pre_operation` allows downstream components to finish shutting down
before cutting power.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "compute",
      "stage": 1,
      "max_parallel": 8,
      "timeout": "20m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "nvswitch",
      "stage": 2,
      "max_parallel": 4,
      "timeout": "15m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 3,
      "max_parallel": 1,
      "timeout": "10m",
      "retry": {
        "max_attempts": 3,
        "initial_interval": "5s",
        "backoff_coefficient": 2.0
      },
      "pre_operation": [
        {
          "name": "Sleep",
          "parameters": { "duration": "30s" }
        }
      ],
      "main_operation": { "name": "PowerControl" },
      "post_operation": [
        {
          "name": "VerifyPowerStatus",
          "timeout": "30s",
          "poll_interval": "5s",
          "parameters": { "expected_status": "off" }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Forceful power on

Skips per-stage verification for maximum speed. All power commands are issued
first; a dedicated final stage (4) verifies all component types simultaneously.

```json
{
  "version": "v1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "component_type": "powershelf",
      "stage": 1,

      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Execution behavior

Flow selects an explicit `rule_id` first, then a rack-specific rule association, then a global default for the operation, and finally a built-in fallback. An explicit rule that cannot be loaded returns an error instead of falling back. The selected rule is embedded in workflow input before execution starts.

Stages run in order. A failed stage stops the task; earlier stages are not rolled back. Steps for component types absent from the rack are skipped. Activity retries can repeat external calls. The child-workflow execution timeout includes the configured retry budget, declared pre/post action timeouts, and a scheduling buffer; it is not equal to the step timeout.

When `retry` is omitted, activities default to three attempts, but the child
workflow budget counts only one attempt per main-action batch. With unlimited
parallelism and no step timeout or pre/post action timeouts, the child budget
is 32 minutes, while each activity attempt
can take 20 minutes. The child deadline can therefore stop execution before
all three attempts finish.

For Temporal workflow and activity details, see [Operation Rule Execution](../../development/flow/operation-rule-execution.md).

## REST power operations

Rack and tray power requests accept `On`, `Off`, `Cycle`, `ForceOff`,
`ForceCycle`, and `ACPowerCycle`. Use these canonical values in new clients;
exact lowercase forms remain accepted for compatibility.

`ACPowerCycle` removes and restores AC power. With the default operation rule,
it applies only to compute trays; NVSwitch and power-shelf trays are not
AC-cycled. Viking systems (DGX H100) do not support this operation.

A successful request returns task IDs, not the result of the hardware operation.
Poll [Retrieve a Task](api:GET/v2/org/:org/nico/task/:id) for each ID until it
reaches `Succeeded`, `Failed`, or `Terminated`. NICo Core validates platform
support: a rejected AC power cycle fails the task, with details in `message`
and, when available, `report.error`.

Use the [Rack power](api:PATCH/v2/org/:org/nico/rack/:id/power) or
[Tray power](api:PATCH/v2/org/:org/nico/tray/:id/power) endpoint for one target;
the corresponding batch endpoints support selecting multiple targets.

## CLI Usage

The examples use a local development Flow service and run from `rest-api/flow/`. Configure the client connection and authentication for other environments before running mutating commands. `--dry-run` validates a batch without contacting the server.

Batch lookup matches operation type and operation code, not the rule name. `--overwrite` deletes the matching rule before creating its replacement; it is not an atomic update and can remove rack associations. Use it only after reviewing affected rules and bindings.

Creating with `--is-default` fails if a default already exists for that operation. To change the default, create a non-default rule and use `set-default`. Replace `<rule-id>` and `<rack-id>` below with existing UUIDs. Save the Graceful power on JSON example as `my-rule.json` for the single-rule command.

### Create a single rule

```bash
flow rule create \
  --name "Graceful Power On" \
  --description "Power-on with verification" \
  --operation-type power_control \
  --operation power_on \
  --rule-file my-rule.json \
  --is-default
```

### Load rules from a YAML batch file

```bash
# Create (skip existing operation type/code pairs)
flow rule create --from-yaml examples/operation-rules-example.yaml

# Create or overwrite existing rules
flow rule create --from-yaml examples/operation-rules-example.yaml --overwrite

# Validate without writing to the database
flow rule create --from-yaml examples/operation-rules-example.yaml --dry-run
```

### Manage rules

```bash
# List all rules
flow rule list

# Set a rule as the default for its operation
flow rule set-default --id <rule-id>

# Associate a rule with a specific rack
flow rule associate --rack-id <rack-id> --rule-id <rule-id>
```

A batch must contain every required operation for each included operation type. The small YAML below illustrates structure only; use the complete reference file for batch loading. Single-rule flags (`--name`, `--rule-file`, `--operation-type`, `--operation`, `--is-default`) cannot be combined with `--from-yaml`. `--dry-run` and `--overwrite` are batch options.

### YAML batch file format

```yaml
version: v1

rules:
  - name: "My Power On Rule"
    description: "..."
    operation_type: power_control
    operation: power_on
    steps:
      - component_type: powershelf
        stage: 1
        max_parallel: 1
        timeout: 10m
        main_operation:
          name: PowerControl
        post_operation:
          - name: VerifyPowerStatus
            timeout: 30s
            poll_interval: 5s
            parameters:
              expected_status: "on"
