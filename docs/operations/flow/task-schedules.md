# Task Schedules <Badge intent="info">v2.2</Badge> <Badge intent="launch" minimal>New</Badge>

User-defined task schedules let operators automate recurring or one-shot
operations (power control, firmware upgrade, bring-up, ingest) against a
persistent set of rack targets, without requiring an external scheduler.

## Concepts

A schedule contains timing, an operation template, an overlap policy, and a persistent scope. Each scope entry selects a rack and optional component filter, and records its last submitted task. The dispatcher submits a task for each eligible scope when the schedule fires.

## Schedule Types

The `spec_type` field selects the scheduling mechanism. The `spec` field
carries a type-specific string.

| `spec_type` | `spec` format | Example | `timezone` used? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `interval` | Go duration string | `"24h"`, `"30m"` | No |
| `cron` | 5-field cron expression (minute hour dom month dow) | `"0 2 * * 1"` (Mon 02:00) | Yes |
| `one-time` | RFC 3339 timestamp | `"2026-06-01T04:00:00Z"` | No |

### Interval

`next_run_at` is set to `now + duration` when the schedule is created or
resumed. After a firing or overlap skip, the next time is the dispatch time plus the interval. Missed intervals are not replayed. The duration must be positive.

### Cron

`next_run_at` is computed by evaluating the cron expression in the schedule's
IANA timezone (default `"UTC"`). The timezone only affects cron: interval and
one-time specs are always absolute.

```text
# Examples
"0 2 * * *"    — every day at 02:00 in the schedule's timezone
"0 */6 * * *"  — every 6 hours
"30 8 * * 1-5" — Mon–Fri at 08:30
```

#### Timezone format

Use `UTC` or an IANA location such as `America/Los_Angeles`, `Europe/London`, or `Asia/Tokyo`. Flow resolves names through Go's timezone database; availability of aliases such as `EST` depends on that database. Use full location names for portable configuration. An unresolvable cron timezone is rejected. The timezone is not used to interpret interval or one-time specs.

### One-Time

Becomes due at the specified RFC 3339 timestamp, including its explicit offset. Dispatch normalizes it to UTC. A timestamp in the past is due on the next poll. After firing, `enabled` is
set to `false` and `next_run_at` is cleared. A consumed one-time schedule
cannot be re-armed (create a new one instead).

## Overlap Policy

Controls what happens when a schedule fires while the previous task for the
same scope is still active (waiting, pending, or running).

| Policy | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `skip` (default) | The scope is silently skipped for this firing cycle. The schedule still advances `next_run_at`. |
| `queue` | The new task is submitted unconditionally. The task manager queues it behind the active task per its own conflict rules. |

The overlap check is per-scope: a schedule with five rack targets can fire on
four racks while skipping the one whose previous task is still running.

The policy is **not** consulted for manual triggers (`TriggerTaskSchedule`):
all scopes are submitted unconditionally.

## Scope and Component Filters

A schedule's scope is the set of racks it targets. Each scope entry targets one rack, with an optional
`component_filter` that restricts which components in that rack are included.

### Component filter variants

These JSON forms describe the stored scope filter. RPC requests use the typed `target_spec` and component-filter messages from the [gRPC reference](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/blob/main/rest-api/flow/docs/grpc-api.md).

| Filter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `null` (absent) | All components in the rack |
| `{"kind":"types","types":["COMPUTE","NVSWITCH"]}` | Only components of the listed types |
| `{"kind":"components","components":["<uuid>","<uuid>"]}` | Specific components by UUID |

### Scope management RPCs

Four RPCs manage scope after a schedule is created:

| RPC | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `AddTaskScheduleScope` | Additive: merges incoming racks into the existing scope. A rack not yet in scope is added as-is. A rack already present has its component filter merged with the incoming filter (see merge rules below). Existing racks are never removed. |
| `UpdateTaskScheduleScope` | Reconciling: replaces the scope to match a desired `target_spec` exactly. Racks not in the desired spec are removed; racks in the desired spec but not in the current scope are added; racks in both have their filter replaced if changed. |
| `RemoveTaskScheduleScope` | Removes a single scope entry by its `scope_id`. In-flight tasks are not cancelled. |
| `ListTaskScheduleScopes` | Returns all scope entries for a schedule. |

#### Filter merge rules (AddTaskScheduleScope only)

When the incoming rack already has a scope entry, the existing and incoming
`component_filter` values are merged according to these rules:

| Existing filter | Incoming filter | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `null` (all components) | anything | `null` — existing filter already covers everything; incoming is ignored |
| anything | `null` (all components) | `null` — widens to all components |
| `{"kind":"types", ...}` | `{"kind":"types", ...}` | `{"kind":"types", ...}` — union of both type lists |
| `{"kind":"components", ...}` | `{"kind":"components", ...}` | `{"kind":"components", ...}` — union of both UUID lists |
| `{"kind":"types", ...}` | `{"kind":"components", ...}` | **Error** — cannot merge filters of different kinds |
| `{"kind":"components", ...}` | `{"kind":"types", ...}` | **Error** — cannot merge filters of different kinds |

If a merge error occurs for any rack, the entire `AddTaskScheduleScope`
request fails and no changes are persisted. To change the kind of filter on
an existing scope entry, use `UpdateTaskScheduleScope` (which replaces rather
than merges) or remove the scope entry first.

For component-level targets (specific component UUIDs), the server resolves
which rack each component belongs to and groups them into per-rack scope
entries automatically.

## API Reference

All RPCs live in the `Flow` gRPC service.

### CreateTaskSchedule

Creates a schedule and its initial scope in a single transaction.

**Required fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `schedule.name` | Must be unique across all schedules. |
| `schedule.spec.type` | `INTERVAL`, `CRON`, or `ONE_TIME`. |
| `schedule.spec.spec` | Duration string, cron expression, or RFC 3339 timestamp. |
| `operation` (oneof) | One of `power_on`, `power_off`, `power_reset`, `bring_up`, `upgrade_firmware`, `ingest`. The `target_spec` embedded in the operation message defines the initial scope. |

**Optional fields:**

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule.spec.timezone` | `"UTC"` | Used only for cron specs; see [Timezone format](#timezone-format) for accepted names and alias handling. |
| `schedule.overlap_policy` | `skip` | `SKIP` or `QUEUE`. |

The initial scope is derived from the operation's `target_spec`. Use the scope
management RPCs to modify it after creation.

### UpdateTaskSchedule

Updates the scheduling config of an existing schedule. `update_mask` is
required and controls which fields are written.

| Mask path | Effect |
|---|---|
| `"schedule.name"` | Replaces the display name; it must remain unique across all schedules. |
| `"schedule.overlap_policy"` | Replaces the overlap behaviour. |
| `"schedule.spec"` | Replaces the full spec block (type + spec string). `next_run_at` is recomputed. |
| `"schedule.spec.timezone"` | Replaces the timezone only. The spec type and string are unchanged. |

Renaming a schedule to another schedule's name fails the database uniqueness
constraint and returns gRPC `UNKNOWN`. The update is rejected without changing
the schedule, including other fields supplied in the same request.

The operation itself (what the schedule runs) and scope (which racks it targets)
cannot be changed via `UpdateTaskSchedule`. To change the operation, delete the
schedule and create a new one. To change the scope, use the scope management
RPCs.

### PauseTaskSchedule / ResumeTaskSchedule

**Pause** sets `enabled = false`. The schedule will not fire until resumed.
Calling pause on an already-paused schedule is a no-op. Pausing a one-time
schedule that has already fired returns an error (nothing to pause).

**Resume** sets `enabled = true`. For interval and cron schedules `next_run_at`
is recomputed from the current time so the schedule does not fire immediately
if `next_run_at` is still in the past from before the pause. For a one-time
schedule that was paused before firing, `next_run_at` is left unchanged.
Resuming a one-time schedule that has already fired (no `next_run_at`) returns
an error.

### TriggerTaskSchedule

Fires the schedule immediately, regardless of `next_run_at` or `enabled` state.
All scopes are submitted unconditionally (the overlap policy is ignored).
After firing:

- `last_run_at` is set on the schedule.
- For interval/cron schedules, `next_run_at` advances normally.
- For one-time schedules, `enabled` is set to `false` and `next_run_at` is
  cleared (consumed).

Returns an error if called on a one-time schedule that has already fired.

### DeleteTaskSchedule

Deletes the schedule and all its scope entries.
In-flight tasks are **not** cancelled.

### ListTaskSchedules

Returns schedules ordered by `created_at` ascending.

| Filter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `rack_id` | Return only schedules with a scope entry on this rack. |
| `enabled_only` | Exclude paused schedules. |
| `pagination` | `offset` / `limit` for paging. Omit to return all. |

The response includes `total`: the count before pagination is applied.

## Dispatch and failure behavior

Automatic dispatch polls for due schedules every 10 seconds by default. This is a polling interval, not a guaranteed execution deadline.

Flow advances the schedule before submitting tasks. A failed submission for one scope does not prevent other scopes from being submitted, and the same tick is not automatically retried. A one-time schedule is consumed even if all scopes are skipped by overlap policy or task submission fails. Check the resulting tasks rather than treating `last_run_at` as proof that the hardware operation succeeded.

Pausing or deleting a schedule does not cancel tasks already submitted. Use task controls to manage those tasks separately.

## Conflict Checks

`CheckScheduleConflicts` is an advisory RPC that checks whether a proposed
scheduled operation would overlap with any existing enabled schedule on the
same racks. It returns the conflicting schedules (if any) but does **not**
block creation.

**The check is coarse by design.** It compares only the operation type and
code; it does not intersect component-type filters or explicit component UUID
lists. Two schedules that target entirely disjoint component sets on the same
rack will still be reported as conflicting. Treat a non-empty response as a
signal for human review, not a guarantee that tasks will collide at runtime.
Execution-time conflict detection (the task manager's conflict rules) remains
the authoritative backstop.
