# Upgrading NICo <Badge intent="info">v2.1</Badge>

`setup.sh` is designed to be **idempotent** for supported deployment topologies: running it against an existing NICo installation upgrades each component in place. The same script and values files used for initial installation are the mechanism for upgrades — there is no separate upgrade script. For a predecessor Flow Deployment that bundles PSM or NSM, first choose whether to preserve it or follow the [manual Flow-only overwrite guidance](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/blob/main/helm-prereqs/README.md#upgrading-deployments-that-bundled-psm-and-nsm).

This page documents how each component behaves when you re-run `setup.sh` against a live cluster, what to prepare before upgrading, and version-specific considerations for the 2.0-to-2.1 upgrade path.

## How setup.sh handles upgrades

After any required manual Flow overwrite, every installation phase is safe to re-run:

| Phase | Behavior on re-run |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| **1 — local-path-provisioner** | Manifests applied using `kubectl apply` are idempotent. The StorageClass is **deleted and re-created** on every run (its `provisioner` field is immutable). Existing PVs and PVCs are unaffected, but new PVC provisioning fails during that brief window. |
| **1b — postgres-operator** | `helmfile sync` issues `helm upgrade --install` — upgrades the release in place. Existing `PostgreSQL` CRs (including `nico-pg-cluster`) are untouched. |
| **1c — MetalLB** | CRDs are applied server-side with `--force-conflicts`. Any Helm-owned CRDs from a prior install have their ownership labels stripped before sync, preventing deletion. `helmfile sync` upgrades the release. Existing `IPAddressPool`, `BGPPeer`, and `BGPAdvertisement` instances are preserved and re-applied (idempotent `kubectl apply`). Refer to [MetalLB CRD ownership](#20--21-metallb-crd-ownership-migration). |
| **2 — cert-manager** | `helmfile sync` upgrades the release. Existing `ClusterIssuer`, `Certificate`, and `CertificateRequest` objects are untouched. The Vault TLS bootstrap certs are re-applied server-side; existing certs that are still valid are not reissued. |
| **3 — Vault** | `helmfile sync` upgrades the release. The StatefulSet uses `updateStrategy: OnDelete`, so running Vault pods are left alone. A changed pod template, for example new probe settings, reaches a pod only when that pod is deleted, and `setup.sh` prints a warning naming such pods. |
| **4 — Vault unseal** | `unseal_vault.sh` checks whether Vault is already initialized. If it is, it skips `vault operator init` and only unseals any pods that were restarted and became sealed again. The Vault cluster keys (`vault-cluster-keys` Secret) and root token (`vaultroottoken`) are preserved. |
| **4 (SSH host key)** | `bootstrap_ssh_host_key.sh` detects an existing SSH host key Secret and skips re-generation. The cluster's SSH identity is preserved across upgrades. |
| **5 — external-secrets + nico-prereqs** | `helmfile sync` upgrades both releases. Existing `ClusterSecretStore` and `ExternalSecret` objects are reconciled to their new definitions. The ESO controller re-syncs all secrets on the next poll cycle. |
| **5b — DPF** | DPF components are upgraded via their Helm charts. The `DPFOperatorConfig`, `DPUCluster`, and `DPUService` objects are preserved. Refer to [DPF version update](#20--21-dpf-version-update). |
| **5c - [RMS](https://docs.nvidia.com/rms/documentation/home/)** | Unless `--skip-rms` is passed: the rack-manager release is upgraded via `helm upgrade --install` from the pinned `helm-prereqs/nv-rms` submodule. The RMS database on `nico-pg-cluster`, the ESO-synced credentials, and the operator-edited state are preserved. Seeding is create-if-absent; re-runs never overwrite. RMS does not reload its TLS material - after a certificate renewal, restart with `kubectl rollout restart deployment/rms-api-server -n rack-manager`. |
| **6 — NICo Core** | `helm upgrade --install nico` rolls out the new Core image tag. On DPF sites, the same deployment carries `[dpf].enabled = true`; there is no preliminary DPF-disabled deployment or second Core rollout. The chart hashes its ConfigMap inputs into the pod template, so a changed site config also rolls `nico-api` when the image is unchanged; an unchanged rerun does not restart it. The PostgreSQL database schema is migrated by the pre-upgrade Job (uses the `imagepullsecret` Secret, which is upserted). NICo state (host records, machine state, firmware inventory) lives in PostgreSQL and is preserved. |
| **7a–7g — NICo REST** | REST components are upgraded via `helm upgrade --install`. The `nico_rest` PostgreSQL database is migrated in-place by the REST migration Job. Temporal workflow state is preserved. The Keycloak realm and client credentials are preserved. |
| **7h — NICo Flow** | The Flow-only release is upgraded in place. A predecessor Deployment or active Pod that still contains PSM or NSM is rejected before setup changes the cluster. |
| **7i — NICo REST site-agent** | The site-agent StatefulSet is upgraded. The site UUID (stored in the `site-registration` Secret) and REST site record are preserved. |

### What is preserved across upgrades

- **Vault cluster**: init state, unseal keys, PKI chain, AppRole credentials, all secrets. Vault is never re-initialized on an upgrade run.
- **PostgreSQL data**: all NICo Core and NICo REST database state, including host records, machine state, and site config in `nico-pg-cluster`. Keycloak realm data and Temporal workflow history live in a **separate** plain `postgres` StatefulSet in the same namespace (created in phase 7c) and are also preserved.
- **MetalLB site config**: `IPAddressPool`, `BGPPeer`, `BGPAdvertisement`, and `L2Advertisement` instances. These are re-applied on every run so any manual changes outside `setup.sh` are reconciled back to the values in `values/metallb-config.yaml`.
- **SSH host key**: the cluster SSH identity is preserved so BMC consoles do not require known-host updates.
- **Site UUID**: the REST site identity and site-agent registration are preserved — as long as `NICO_SITE_UUID` is unset or identical to the initial install; a different value deletes and re-creates the `site-registration` Secret.
- **Certificates**: all cert-manager-managed certificates remain valid until their natural expiry; they are not reissued on upgrade unless the new release changes a Certificate spec.

### What changes during an upgrade

- All Helm release images are updated to the new tags set in `NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG`, `NICO_REST_IMAGE_TAG`, etc.
- CRD schemas are updated to their new versions via server-side apply.
- ConfigMaps and Secrets produced by Helm are updated to reflect new chart values.
- The NICo Core and REST database schemas are migrated forward by their respective pre-upgrade Jobs.
- The DPF operator chart is reinstalled from the `helm-prereqs/doca-platform` commit the new `setup.sh` pins, with the operator image tag from `NICO_DPF_IMAGE_TAG` (default: that release). The DPUServices (`dts`, `doca_hbn`, and NICo's `dpu_agent`, `dhcp_server`, `fmds`, `otel`) are versioned independently by `[dpf.services.*]` in the NICo site config ([dpf.md §3.5](dpf.md#35-enable-dpf-in-the-nico-site-config)); the pin does not change them.

## Pre-upgrade checklist

Complete every item before running `setup.sh`. Missing any of these can cause the upgrade to fail or leave the cluster in a partially upgraded state.

If `flow/flow` or an active Flow Pod still contains a `psm` or `nsm` container, do not run setup yet. Preserve that release, or follow the [manual Flow-only overwrite guidance](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/blob/main/helm-prereqs/README.md#upgrading-deployments-that-bundled-psm-and-nsm). Setup rejects that predecessor topology or an incomplete Flow-only rollout before making any cluster change.

<Steps toc={true}>

### Back up Vault unseal keys

Vault unseal keys are stored in the `vault-cluster-keys` Secret in the `vault` namespace. If this Secret is lost and all Vault pods restart simultaneously, the Vault data is unrecoverable — a Raft snapshot does **not** substitute for the unseal keys, because snapshots are encrypted with the same keyring the keys protect.

```bash
# Verify the backup Secret exists
kubectl get secret vault-cluster-keys -n vault -o jsonpath='{.metadata.name}'
```

Export and store it offline:

```bash
umask 077   # keep the backup readable only by you
kubectl get secret vault-cluster-keys -n vault -o json > vault-cluster-keys-backup.json
```

<Warning>
This file contains the plaintext Vault unseal keys **and the Vault root token**. Anyone holding it has full control of Vault. Store it in a secure, offline location and delete the local copy after storing.
</Warning>

### Back up the secrets KEK

If the site keeps credentials in Postgres (as detailed in [Secrets Storage](../configuration/secrets-storage.md)), the database dump below holds only ciphertext, and every key encryption key (KEK) its rows reference is needed to read it back.

With an Integrated provider, export every Secret that holds key material your `[secrets.kms]` providers reference, including keys that are no longer routed but are still needed for older rows or older dumps, and store them with the Vault unseal keys. Copy a key supplied from a file or an inline value from its source instead.

The following command exports one Secret; repeat it for each:

```bash
tmp=$(mktemp nico-secrets-kek-backup.XXXXXX)   # created with mode 0600
kubectl get secret nico-secrets-kek -n nico-system -o json > "$tmp" \
  && mv "$tmp" nico-secrets-kek-backup.json   # keep the old backup if the export fails
```

With a Transit provider the KEK lives in the Transit engine's storage, which the unseal-key export above does not include; take a Vault storage snapshot as well, for example `vault operator raft snapshot save vault-storage.snap`.

<Warning>
This file contains the plaintext KEK. Anyone holding it together with a database dump can decrypt every stored credential. Store it where you store the unseal keys and delete the local copy.
</Warning>

### Back up the databases

Take the backup **before** the upgrade — once the new version's migrations run, the prior image tags alone are no longer a working rollback. There are **two** PostgreSQL instances in the `postgres` namespace, and both need a dump:

```bash
umask 077
# nico-pg-cluster: nico_system_nico, nico_rest, flow, and any retained predecessor psm/nsm databases
kubectl exec -n postgres \
    "$(kubectl get pods -n postgres -l application=spilo,spilo-role=master -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" \
    -- su postgres -c "pg_dumpall" > nico_pg_pre_upgrade.sql

# plain `postgres` StatefulSet: temporal, temporal_visibility, keycloak
kubectl exec -n postgres postgres-0 -- pg_dumpall -U postgres > nico_rest_pg_pre_upgrade.sql
```

<Note>
These are **logical** dumps, not PVC snapshots. Restoring means recreating the databases from SQL — expect downtime proportional to database size — and in-flight Temporal workflows at dump time cannot be replayed. If your storage class supports volume snapshots, snapshot the PostgreSQL and Vault PVCs as well for a faster, more complete restore point.
</Note>

### Check cluster health before upgrading

Do not upgrade a cluster that already has degraded components. Resolve any existing issues first.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nico-system
kubectl get pods -n nico-rest
kubectl get pods -n temporal
kubectl get pods -n vault
kubectl get pods -n postgres
kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
kubectl get pods -n dpf-operator-system   # if DPF is enabled — phase 5b upgrades it
```

All pods should be `Running` or `Completed`. Check for pods stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Pending`, or `Error`.

Capture the current LoadBalancer VIP assignments as a baseline — the post-upgrade verification diffs against this. The command records only stable fields (namespace, name, VIP) across **all** namespaces, so cosmetic changes such as `AGE` or port ordering cannot show up as false diffs:

```bash
kubectl get svc -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.spec.type=="LoadBalancer")]}{.metadata.namespace}{"/"}{.metadata.name}{" "}{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}{"\n"}{end}' \
    > pre-upgrade-vips.txt
```

Verify that Vault is fully unsealed — a sealed Vault blocks the upgrade at phase 4:

```bash
kubectl exec -n vault vault-0 -c vault -- vault status -tls-skip-verify | grep -E "Sealed|Initialized"
```

Both should show `Initialized true` and `Sealed false`.

### Pull the new release

Update your local checkout to the target release branch or tag. The commands below assume an `upstream` remote pointing at the main repository; add it once with `git remote add upstream https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller.git` (or substitute `origin` if you cloned the main repository directly):

```bash
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/release/v2.1   # or the specific release tag
```

Review the release changelog for breaking changes:

- `fern/changelog/` — user-facing changelog entries
- `helm-prereqs/` diff from the prior release — any new required values fields or removed flags

### Review values file changes

Check whether the new release added required values fields or changed any default values. If so, update your site values files to include any new required fields before running `setup.sh`.

```bash
git diff upstream/release/v2.0..upstream/release/v2.1 -- helm-prereqs/values.yaml \
    helm-prereqs/values/nico-core.yaml \
    helm-prereqs/values/nico-rest.yaml \
    helm-prereqs/values/metallb-config.yaml
```

### Update image tags

Set the new image tags for the target release:

```bash
export NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY=registry.example.com/nico   # your registry
export NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG=v2.1.0                      # new Core tag
export NICO_REST_IMAGE_TAG=v2.1.0                      # new REST tag
```

If you are upgrading DPF as part of this release, the DPF version is the pinned `helm-prereqs/doca-platform` commit of the `setup.sh` you run: the submodule gitlink in a git checkout, or `helm-prereqs/doca-platform.pin` in the packaged `nico-prereqs` chart, which `setup.sh` clones at that commit. There is no version variable to set, and both paths install the same commit. Air-gapped sites that set `NICO_DPF_SRC` manage that checkout themselves: update it to the same commit (`git submodule status helm-prereqs/doca-platform`, or the sha in `doca-platform.pin`), because `setup.sh` installs whatever it contains and only warns when its HEAD differs from the pin. Remove `NICO_DPF_VERSION` and `NICO_DPF_SRC_DIR` from your environment files: `setup.sh` now rejects them when installing DPF. A leftover `helm-prereqs/.dpf-src/` clone from earlier releases is no longer used and can be deleted.

DPF is enabled by default, and on DPF sites two more variables are **required** — preflight raises hard errors when they are unset:

```bash
export NICO_DPF_DPU_INTERFACE=<DPU high-speed interface, e.g. ens1f0np0>
export NICO_DPF_DPU_CLUSTER_VIP=<VIP for the DPU cluster control plane>
```

Set them to the same values used at initial install (they are not persisted by `setup.sh`).

### Prepare Virtualized-to-Flat Routing for a 2.2-to-2.3 Upgrade

Before upgrading an agent that serves an active Virtualized-to-Flat peering, inspect every affected Flat prefix contained by an effective `site_fabric_null_routes` prefix. Ensure the tenant VRF learns an imported or explicitly admitted underlay route that is at least as specific as the containing blackhole, and verify forward and return reachability before starting the agent rollout. A leaked default does not qualify when the blackhole is more specific than `/0`; combining a `/0` null route with same-family default-route leakage is unsupported. Follow the [FNN-to-Flat routing prerequisite](vpc/vpc_peering_management.md#virtualized-to-flat-routing-prerequisite) for the supported route-provisioning methods.

### Run the pre-flight check

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
source ./preflight.sh
```

Fix all errors before proceeding. On DPF sites, registration of a new DPUDevice
remains blocked until the site-wide BMC root is available from the configured
credential sources and the 60-second refresh publishes the derived
current-version `bmc-shared-password` Secret. NICo retains an existing Secret,
but does not infer startup readiness from that retained value. This does not
prevent a `local_first` or `backend` Core rollout; Core starts and retries the
source. Authoritative `local` mode requires version 0 before Core starts when
v0 is current or the current target cannot be resolved.

### DPF BMC root ownership on upgrade

The backward-compatible default is
`nico-api.credentials.bmcSiteWideRootSource: local_first`. An existing
backend-owned version 0 credential therefore remains in use without a new
Secret when `NICO_DPF_BMC_ROOT_PASSWORD` is unset. When it is set, setup creates
`nico-system/nico-bmc-v0-credentials`, configures authoritative local ownership,
and deploys Core once with DPF enabled. A later DPF-enabled Core deployment
reuses that Secret even if the variable is omitted. Declining deployment leaves
it untouched. A later non-DPF Core deployment preserves the mount and local
ownership only when the installed release already uses this exact configuration;
a stray Secret is not adopted. A different supplied value fails rather than
overwriting version 0. If
coordinated BMC rotation has advanced the target to version 1 or
later, that version remains backend-resolved. A rerun also removes the obsolete
`dpf-set-bmc-root` Job and its `dpf-bmc-root-pw` and `dpf-admincli-cert` Secrets
if an interrupted older setup left them behind.

To opt into local ownership of version 0, first create a Kubernetes Secret whose
sparse credential file contains the exact existing version 0 value. Then add
both `nico-api.credentials.file.existingSecret` and
`nico-api.credentials.bmcSiteWideRootSource: local` to the persistent Core
values before rerunning `setup.sh`. As a shortcut when no other credential-file
Secret is configured, export the exact existing value as
`NICO_DPF_BMC_ROOT_PASSWORD`; setup creates and wires its dedicated Secret. Do
not use that shortcut when the Core values name another credential-file Secret.
Ensure the environment credential source does not also supply this entry,
because it precedes the file. A Secret created without the values update is not
mounted. With DPF enabled, carbide-api requires local v0 before starting on
fresh and existing sites whenever v0 is current or the current target cannot be
resolved. A target at version 1 or later does not require local v0 before
startup. This prevents a rolling update from activating local ownership while
an older replica can still register a DPU that uses the shared credential. A
transient rotation-target read failure does not block startup when local v0 is
present. After NICo accepts local v0, removing it retains the last accepted
shared Secret and logs an error until the original value is restored.
The default pinned DPF v26.4.0 does not support BMC credential rotation;
adopting and validating supporting DPF behavior is tracked by
[#6147](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/6147). If the rotation
target is already version 1 or later, the local
version 0 entry does not become current. If devices still use version 0, keep
the copied local value unchanged after this ownership migration; later password
changes must use coordinated BMC rotation so hardware and convergence records
advance together. Do not stage that rotation while DPF manages any DPU: its
single shared BMC Secret cannot authenticate a mixed-version fleet. DPF
credential rotation is tracked by
[#6147](https://github.com/NVIDIA/infra-controller/issues/6147). See
[Credential Sources](../configuration/credential-sources.md#site-wide-bmc-root-version-0-ownership-policy).

<Warning>
`setup.sh -y` does **not** stop on preflight errors — with `-y` set, hard errors are printed and the run continues ("Things may fail"). The preflight gate is only enforced interactively, so genuinely resolve every error here rather than relying on the script to stop you.
</Warning>

</Steps>

## Running the upgrade

With the checklist complete — including the [version-specific notes](#version-specific-upgrade-notes) for your upgrade path, which describe behavior that happens *during* the run — run `setup.sh` exactly as you would for a fresh install:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
./setup.sh -y
```

<Warning>
If a phase fails, `setup.sh` prints `SETUP FAILED` and offers: `Run clean.sh to revert the cluster now? [y/N]`. **Always answer `N` on an upgrade.** `clean.sh` is a full teardown — it deletes the Vault key Secrets (`vault-cluster-keys`, `vaultroottoken`), the `postgres`, `nico-rest`, `temporal`, and `flow` namespaces, and flips local-path PVs to `Delete` so their host directories are reclaimed. Accepting it destroys the very data the upgrade preserves. Diagnose the failed phase and re-run `setup.sh` instead.
</Warning>

`setup.sh` processes all phases in order. Phases that find their components already at the correct state complete quickly. Phases that detect a version delta or config change apply the update.

### Upgrade-specific flags

| Flag | When to use |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `--skip-core` | Skip Phase 6 only. Prerequisites and the REST stack still upgrade; NICo Core is left on its current image. Useful when the Core image did not change. |
| `--skip-rest` | Skip Phase 7 only. Prerequisites and NICo Core still upgrade; the REST stack is left untouched. |
| `--skip-rms` | Skip the Rack Management Service upgrade (Phase 5c). RMS installs **by default** (like DPF); `NICO_RMS_IMAGE_TAG` is required unless this flag is passed. Skipping leaves an existing RMS release untouched. |
| `--skip-dpf` | Use **only** if DPF is not enabled at this site. This is not a pure skip: it clears `INSTALL_DPF`, which drops phase 5b and redeploys NICo Core with the `[dpf]` block disabled — on a DPF-enabled site that is a config change, not a skip. |
| `--core-values <file>` | Use a per-site NICo Core values file (same as initial install). |
| `--metallb-config <path>` | Use a site-specific MetalLB manifest or kustomize dir (same as initial install). |

### Estimated upgrade time

| Phase | Typical duration |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| Phases 1–1c (storage, postgres-operator, MetalLB) | 2–5 min |
| Phases 2–4 (cert-manager, Vault, unseal) | 1–3 min (Vault is already initialized and its pods are not restarted) |
| Phase 5 (ESO + nico-prereqs) | 1–3 min |
| Phase 5b (DPF) | 3–10 min (depends on DPF version delta) |
| Phase 5c (RMS - unless `--skip-rms`) | 1-3 min (certificate issuance + rollout) |
| Phase 6 (NICo Core) | 3–8 min (includes DB migration Job) |
| Phases 7a–7i (NICo REST + site-agent) | 5–15 min (Temporal and DB migrations are the slowest steps) |

Total: typically **15–45 minutes** for a full upgrade with DPF.

## Post-upgrade verification

Run the same checks as after initial installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nico-system
kubectl get pods -n nico-rest
kubectl get pods -n temporal
kubectl get pods -n vault
kubectl get pods -n postgres
kubectl get pods -n metallb-system
kubectl get pods -n dpf-operator-system   # if DPF enabled
```

Verify the deployed image versions match the target tags:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n nico-system nico-api \
    -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}'
```

Verify every LoadBalancer service in the cluster kept its VIP — an upgrade must not reassign them. Diff against the baseline captured in the pre-upgrade checklist (same stable namespace/name/VIP fields):

```bash
kubectl get svc -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[?(@.spec.type=="LoadBalancer")]}{.metadata.namespace}{"/"}{.metadata.name}{" "}{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}{"\n"}{end}' \
    | diff pre-upgrade-vips.txt - && echo "VIPs unchanged"
```

Any diff output or a missing address means MetalLB reassigned or stopped advertising a VIP — check the MetalLB CRDs and site config objects (see the 2.0→2.1 note below) and the pins in `values/nico-core.yaml`.

Verify PostgreSQL has an elected leader and the cluster is running:

```bash
kubectl get postgresql -n postgres nico-pg-cluster -o jsonpath='{.status.PostgresClusterStatus}'
kubectl get pods -n postgres -l application=spilo,spilo-role=master
```

The first command should print `Running`; the second should show exactly one master pod in `Running` state.

Verify NICo Core is serving — hit the same HTTP health port the liveness probe uses (1080, exposed via the metrics Service):

```bash
kubectl run -i --rm --restart=Never --image=curlimages/curl upgrade-check \
  -n nico-system --quiet -- \
  -sf http://nico-api-metrics.nico-system.svc.cluster.local:1080/ >/dev/null && echo "nico-api healthy"
```

Then run the included health check, which covers the full stack (Vault, cert-manager, ESO, MetalLB, `.forge` DNS records):

```bash
cd helm-prereqs/
./health-check.sh
```

## Moving credentials to Postgres

Migrating an existing site's credentials from Vault to Postgres is a configuration walk described in [Secrets Storage](../configuration/secrets-storage.md), and it can be folded into an upgrade window. Two points matter when you migrate:

- Every step changes the `nico-api` config and, in the reference installation, needs `kubectl -n nico-system rollout restart deployment/nico-api`: the chart carries the Stakater Reloader annotation, so installations that run Reloader restart automatically, but the reference installation does not install it.
- The default rolling update also keeps the old pod running until the new one is ready, so finish each step's rollout before starting the next. Keep `bmc_rotation_enabled` and `uefi_rotation_enabled` at their default `false` until the whole fleet runs one config.

Once the writer is Postgres, the KEK backup above belongs in every pre-upgrade checklist.

## Version-specific upgrade notes

### 2.2 → 2.3: Core components are mandatory

**Impact:** The core NICo subcharts (`nico-api`, `nico-bmc-proxy`, `nico-dhcp`, `nico-dns`, `nico-hardware-health`, `nico-pxe`, `nico-ssh-console-rs`) no longer have `<chart>.enabled` toggles - they are unconditional dependencies in `helm/Chart.yaml` and always install. A site values file (including one passed via `setup.sh --core-values`) that still sets a core `<chart>.enabled` key, whether `true` or `false`, keeps working: the key is ignored and the component installs. No values changes are required for the upgrade. If a site previously disabled a core component (for example, a DHCP or BMC proxy provided externally), plan for the in-cluster component to appear after the upgrade. Optional services (`nico-dsx-exchange-consumer`, `nico-ntp`, `unbound`) keep their toggles.

NICo Flow is also mandatory within the REST install: `--skip-flow` and the helm-prereqs `flow.enabled` value were removed, phase 7h has no skip flag of its own and runs whenever REST is installed (only `--skip-rest` skips it, together with all of REST), and the Flow chart moved from `helm/charts/nico-flow` to `helm/nico-flow`. A leftover `nico-flow.enabled` key in umbrella values is ignored, because the umbrella no longer deploys Flow; `setup.sh` installs it. Sites running an external PostgreSQL (`postgresql.enabled: false` in helm-prereqs values) must provision the flow database and the `flow.nico.nico-pg-cluster.credentials` Secret in the `flow` namespace before running `setup.sh`, or phase 7h fails after its 120s credential wait.

### 2.0 → 2.1: MetalLB CRD ownership migration

**Impact:** This upgrade path requires special handling that `setup.sh` performs automatically. If you skip MetalLB's phase in your upgrade (for example, by removing it from the helmfile run), your site config objects (`IPAddressPool`, `BGPPeer`, `BGPAdvertisement`) will be deleted.

**Root cause:** In NICo 2.0, MetalLB was deployed with `crds.enabled: true` (the Helm chart default), which places all seven MetalLB CRDs inside the Helm release manifest. In NICo 2.1, `crds.enabled: false` is set explicitly so that the MetalLB cert rotator can take SSA field ownership of the CRD `caBundle` without conflicting with Helm on every re-sync. When Helm sees `crds.enabled` change from `true` to `false`, it removes the CRDs from its manifest — and Kubernetes garbage-collects every `IPAddressPool`, `BGPPeer`, and `BGPAdvertisement` instance stored as CRD resources, permanently deleting your site config.

**How setup.sh handles this:** Before running `helmfile sync` for MetalLB, `setup.sh` strips the `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: Helm` label and the `meta.helm.sh/release-name` / `meta.helm.sh/release-namespace` annotations from any existing MetalLB CRDs. With the labels removed, Helm does not consider the CRDs part of its managed set and does not delete them during the sync. CRDs are then applied directly (server-side, `--force-conflicts`) before and after the helmfile sync.

**If you are upgrading manually** (not via `setup.sh`), you must strip Helm ownership from all MetalLB CRDs before running `helmfile sync` or `helm upgrade`:

```bash
for crd in $(kubectl get crd -o name | grep '\.metallb\.io$'); do
    kubectl annotate "${crd}" meta.helm.sh/release-name- meta.helm.sh/release-namespace- --overwrite
    kubectl label  "${crd}" app.kubernetes.io/managed-by- --overwrite
done
```

Then apply the CRDs directly before sync:

```bash
METALLB_VERSION="0.14.5"   # match the version in helmfile.yaml
helm template metallb metallb/metallb --version "${METALLB_VERSION}" \
    -n metallb-system --include-crds \
    | awk '/^---[[:space:]]*$/ { if (doc ~ /kind: CustomResourceDefinition/) printf "%s---\n", doc; doc = ""; next } { doc = doc $0 "\n" } END { if (doc ~ /kind: CustomResourceDefinition/) printf "%s", doc }' \
    | kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f -

### 2.0 → 2.1: DPF version update

The `helm-prereqs/doca-platform` submodule pin is updated with each NICo minor release to the tested DOCA Platform Framework version. On a 2.0→2.1 upgrade, DPF is upgraded from its 2.0 version to the 2.1 version automatically as part of phase 5b.

DPF manages DPU provisioning state in `DPUCluster`, `DPUService`, and `DPF` CRs, all of which persist across the upgrade. In-flight DPU provisioning workflows may pause while the DPF operator restarts; they resume automatically when the new operator pod comes up.

### 2.0 → 2.1: NICo Core startupProbe

NICo 2.1 requires `startupProbe` to be explicitly configured in the machine-a-tron deployment (issue #4298). The chart now validates this at render time and fails with a clear error if `startupProbe` is absent.

### 2.1 → 2.2: NICo REST postgres volume size

NICo 2.2 raises the `postgres` StatefulSet's `volumeClaimTemplates` storage request from 1Gi to 10Gi. Kubernetes forbids changing that field on an existing StatefulSet, so phase 7c of `setup.sh` deletes the StatefulSet with `--cascade=orphan` and re-applies it; the `postgres-0` pod and its `postgres-data-postgres-0` PVC are kept. The PVC of an upgraded site stays at 1Gi. It can be left as is, or grown in place if the StorageClass has `allowVolumeExpansion: true` and its storage provisioner supports expansion:

```bash
kubectl patch pvc postgres-data-postgres-0 -n postgres \
    -p '{"spec":{"resources":{"requests":{"storage":"10Gi"}}}}'
```

### 2.2 → 2.3: Machine-a-Tron startupProbe Default

NICo 2.3 raises the default `startupProbe.failureThreshold` from 20 to 120 (60 minutes), sized for a 250-rack site spread over ten pods ([issue 5968](https://github.com/dsx-ai-factory/infra-controller/issues/5968)). The threshold applies to each pod on its own, so size it for the pod that registers the most records. For larger sites, raise `startupProbe.failureThreshold` following the sizing rule in the chart's `values.yaml`, as `helm-prereqs/values/machine-a-tron-scale.yaml` does.

### 2.2 → 2.3: Vault Probe Settings

NICo 2.3 raises the Vault server probe `timeoutSeconds` from 3 to 10 and `failureThreshold` from 2 to 5 in `helm-prereqs/operators/values/vault.yaml`.

For example, on a 250-rack site, the active node missed two 3-second liveness probes under load, was killed, came back sealed, and the standby nodes stayed leaderless.

The Vault StatefulSet uses `updateStrategy: OnDelete`. This means that `helmfile sync` updates the pod template, but running pods keep the old probes until they are deleted. Phase 3 prints a warning naming the pods still running the previous revision. If the StatefulSet status cannot be read or has not caught up, the warning indicates that the revision could not be verified.

After the upgrade finishes, find the active node, then roll the pods one at a time, standby nodes first, and the active node last. The active node is the pod whose `HA Mode` is `active`:

```bash
for pod in vault-0 vault-1 vault-2; do
    echo -n "${pod}: "; kubectl exec -n vault "${pod}" -c vault -- vault status -tls-skip-verify | grep 'HA Mode'
done
```

From the repository root, run the following commands for each standby in turn, and only then for the active node. Replace `<pod>` with the pod being rolled and `<active>` with the pod whose `HA Mode` is `active` at that point. A recreated pod starts sealed and is not Ready until it is unsealed, so the first wait is for `Running`:

```bash
kubectl delete pod -n vault <pod>
kubectl wait pod/<pod> -n vault --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Running --timeout=300s
helm-prereqs/unseal_vault.sh
kubectl wait pod/<pod> -n vault --for=condition=Ready --timeout=300s
kubectl -n vault get secret vaultroottoken -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d \
    | kubectl exec -i -n vault <active> -c vault -- \
        sh -c 'VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat) vault operator raft autopilot state -tls-skip-verify' \
    | sed '/^Servers:/,$d'
```

The root token travels on standard input; it does not appear in the `kubectl exec` arguments that the API server records in audit events. The `sed` operation trims the output to the cluster summary: `Healthy`, `Failure Tolerance`, `Leader`, and `Voters`.

`unseal_vault.sh` returns once `vault status` reports the pod unsealed. Unsealing only opens the pod's own storage, and does not show that the pod has rejoined the cluster as a healthy voter. Continue to the next pod only when `Healthy` is `true`, `Failure Tolerance` is `1` on a three-node cluster, and `<pod>` is listed under `Voters`.

Right after the unseal, the summary can still show `Healthy` `false` and `Failure Tolerance` `0` until the leader hears from the pod. Rerun the check after a few seconds. A pod that comes back without its Raft data joins as a non-voter and appears under `Voters` only after autopilot promotes it. Deleting the next standby before the promotion can leave the three-node cluster below quorum. When the former active node is rolled, a standby has taken over; run the status loop again to find `<active>`.

If `kubectl wait` reports the pod as not found, the StatefulSet has not recreated it yet. Run the wait again.

### 2.2 → 2.3: Kustomize deployment deprecated

The Kustomize deployment under `deploy/` (`deploy/kustomization.yaml`,
`deploy/nico-base`, `deploy/nico-system`, `deploy/nico-unbound-base`) is
deprecated in 2.3 and will be removed in 2.4. Every service it deploys has a
Helm chart under `helm/`, and `setup.sh` installs NICo Core from those charts
only. Kustomize deployments keep working in 2.3 but receive no new
configuration. Before upgrading to 2.4, install with the Helm charts as
described in the [quick start](../getting-started/quick-start.md) and retire the
Kustomize overlays. The `rest-api/deploy/kustomize` bases that `setup.sh` uses
for cert-manager, PostgreSQL, and Temporal are not affected.

## Rollback

<Warning>
Downgrades are **not a supported version move**. The [release policy](../../RELEASE.md#upgrade-and-downgrade-support) tests forward upgrades only, and the supported recovery for a bad release is a forward-fix in the next patch. Treat the following procedure as disaster recovery for a failed upgrade, not as a routine operation.
</Warning>

`setup.sh` does not have a built-in rollback mechanism. Rollback consists of:

1. Checking out the prior release branch or tag.
1. Re-running `setup.sh` with the prior image tags.

For NICo Core and REST, the Helm release is rolled back in-place, and the database migration Jobs for the prior version run on startup. NICo's database migrations are designed to be forward-compatible; rolling back does not guarantee schema compatibility if the new version added non-nullable columns. This is why a pre-upgrade database backup is essential.

The database dumps from the [pre-upgrade checklist](#back-up-the-databases) are the rollback foundation: `nico-pg-cluster` holds `nico_system_nico` (NICo Core), `nico_rest` (NICo REST), `flow`, and any retained `psm` or `nsm` databases from a predecessor bundled-manager deployment, while the plain `postgres` StatefulSet holds `temporal`, `temporal_visibility`, and `keycloak`. Restoring means replaying the SQL against a clean instance (`psql -f <dump>.sql`).

Re-running `setup.sh` with the prior image tags alone is **not** a complete rollback if the new version's migrations already ran. Restore the database dumps first, then deploy the prior version.

For DPF, rolling back to a prior DPF version is not supported by NVIDIA. If DPF fails to upgrade, reach out to NVIDIA support rather than attempting a downgrade.

## Using setup.sh for individual component upgrades

You can narrow an upgrade to particular components with the `--skip-*` flags. `--skip-core` and `--skip-rest` skip exactly the phase they name - **none of them skip the prerequisite stack**, and there is no `--skip-prereqs`. NICo Flow (Phase 7h) has no skip flag of its own; it upgrades together with REST and is skipped only by `--skip-rest`. (`--skip-dpf` is the exception: refer to its caveat in the flag table above. `--skip-core` also suppresses the `imagepullsecret` upsert that the Core migration Job uses.)

```bash
# Prerequisites + NICo Core; leave the REST stack untouched (skips Phase 7)
./setup.sh -y --skip-rest

# Prerequisites + NICo REST; leave Core untouched (skips Phase 6)
./setup.sh -y --skip-core

# Prerequisites only, fully non-interactive
./setup.sh -y --skip-core --skip-rest
```

The prerequisite phases therefore run on every invocation. That is by design and is cheap: each one is idempotent, and a phase whose inputs have not changed reconciles to the same state and exits quickly.

For a single-Helm-chart upgrade (such as rotating the NICo Core image tag without going through the full script), run from the **repository root**, matching what `setup.sh` itself executes:

```bash
helm upgrade --install nico ./helm \
    -n nico-system \
    -f helm-prereqs/values/nico-core.yaml \
    --set-string global.image.repository="${NICO_IMAGE_REGISTRY}/nvmetal-carbide" \
    --set-string global.image.tag="${NICO_CORE_IMAGE_TAG}" \
    --timeout 600s --wait
```

<Warning>
This skips the MetalLB CRD handling, DPF management, the `imagepullsecret` upsert the migration Job depends on, and the other prereq phases. Only do this when you are certain those components do not need updating.

**Do not use this command unchanged on a DPF-enabled site**. It omits the
rendered `[dpf]` block and `nico-api.dpf.rbacCreate=true` values that `setup.sh`
adds to the single Core deployment. From the repository root, use
`helm-prereqs/setup.sh -y --skip-rest` instead.
</Warning>
