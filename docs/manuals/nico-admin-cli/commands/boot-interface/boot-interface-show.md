# `nico-admin-cli boot-interface show`

## NAME

nico-admin-cli-boot-interface-show - Show boot interfaces for a machine
from every store (troubleshooting)

## SYNOPSIS

**nico-admin-cli boot-interface show** \[**--extended**\]
\[**--sort-by**\] \[**-h**\|**--help**\] \<*MACHINE*\>

## DESCRIPTION

Gather the boot-interface view for one machine from all four stores and
print them together: the managed \`machine_interfaces\` rows (owned
candidates and primary selection), \`predicted_machine_interfaces\`
(pre-first-lease candidates), the \`explored_endpoints\` default, and
retained post-deletion pairs (including stale records). Also reports the
effective owned pick and flags when current selection signals disagree
(the effective owned pick, explored defaults, and declared-primary
predictions; retained history and the desired target are excluded). The
persisted desired target and reconciliation progress appear separately.
Read-only.

## OPTIONS

**--extended**\
Extended result output.

This used by measured boot, where basic output contains just what you
probably care about, and "extended" output also dumps out all the
internal UUIDs that are used to associate instances.

**--sort-by** *\<SORT_BY\>* \[default: primary-id\]\
Sort output by specified field\

\
*Possible values:*

- primary-id: Sort by the primary ID

- state: Sort by state

**-h**, **--help**\
Print help (see a summary with -h)

\<*MACHINE*\>\
The machine ID for which to gather boot interfaces

## Examples

```sh
nico-admin-cli boot-interface show 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
nico-admin-cli --format json boot-interface show 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
nico-admin-cli --format yaml boot-interface show 12345678-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567
```
