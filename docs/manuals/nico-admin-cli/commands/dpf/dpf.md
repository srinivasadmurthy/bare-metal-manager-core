# `nico-admin-cli dpf`

_[Hardware commands](../../hardware.md) › **dpf**_

## NAME

nico-admin-cli-dpf - DPF-related commands. Note: These commands update
the DPF state of the machine, which determines DPF-based DPU
re-provisioning. The state is saved in the machines metadata and will be
deleted if the machine is force-deleted. To make the state persistent,
add the DPF state for a machine (host) to the expected machines table.

## SYNOPSIS

**nico-admin-cli dpf** \[**--extended**\] \[**--sort-by**\]
\[**-h**\|**--help**\] \<*subcommands*\>

## DESCRIPTION

DPF-related commands. Note: These commands update the DPF state of the
machine, which determines DPF-based DPU re-provisioning. The state is
