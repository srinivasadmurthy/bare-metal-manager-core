# Switch State Diagram

This document describes the Finite State Machine (FSM) for Switches in NICo: lifecycle from creation through configuration, validation, ready, optional rack-level reprovisioning, operator maintenance, and deletion.

## High-Level Overview

The main flow shows the primary states and transitions:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Created" as Created
    state "Initializing (WaitForOsMachineInterface)" as Initializing
    state "Configuring" as Configuring
    state "FetchInfo" as FetchInfo
    state "Validating" as Validating
    state "BomValidating" as BomValidating
    state "Ready" as Ready
    state "Maintenance" as Maintenance
    state "ReProvisioning (rack-level)" as ReProvisioning
    state "Error" as Error
    state "Deleting" as Deleting

    [*] --> Created : Switch created

    Created --> Initializing : controller processes switch
    Initializing --> Configuring : all NVOS interfaces associated
    Initializing --> Error : no NVOS MACs or MAC conflict
    Configuring --> FetchInfo : certificate config and password rotation done
    FetchInfo --> Validating : slot and tray lookup complete
    Validating --> BomValidating : validation complete
    BomValidating --> Ready : BOM validation complete

    Ready --> Deleting : marked for deletion
    Ready --> Maintenance : switch_maintenance_requested
    Ready --> ReProvisioning : rack-level switch_reprovisioning_requested

    Maintenance --> Ready : operation complete
    Maintenance --> Error : operation failed

    Error --> Deleting : marked for deletion
    Error --> Maintenance : switch_maintenance_requested

    ReProvisioning --> Ready : rack maintenance cycle complete
    ReProvisioning --> Error : firmware, NVOS, or fabric manager failure

    Deleting --> [*] : final delete
```

## States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Created** | Switch record exists in NICo; awaiting first controller tick. |
| **Initializing** | Controller waits for expected switch NVOS MAC associations. Sub-state: `WaitForOsMachineInterface`. |
| **Configuring** | Switch is being configured. Sub-states: `ConfigureCertificate` (`Start` → `WaitForComplete { job_id }`), then `RotateOsPassword`. See [Switch Certificate Configuration](switch_configure_certificate.md). |
| **FetchInfo** | Controller fetches rack placement info (slot and tray) from the component manager backend and persists it on the switch record. Warn-and-continue on lookup failure. |
| **Validating** | Switch is being validated. Sub-state: `ValidationComplete`. |
| **BomValidating** | BOM (Bill of Materials) validation. Sub-state: `BomValidationComplete`. |
| **Ready** | Switch is ready for use. Can be deleted, enter operator maintenance, or enter rack-level reprovisioning. |
| **Maintenance** | Operator-requested maintenance in progress. Operation is carried in `operation`: `PowerOn`, `PowerOff`, `Reset`, or `ReconfigureCertificate`. Certificate reconfiguration uses `configure_certificate` sub-states (`Start` → `WaitForComplete { job_id }`). |
| **ReProvisioning** | Rack-driven maintenance in progress. Sub-states: `WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`, `WaitingForNVOSUpgrade`, `WaitingForNMXCConfigure`. The rack state machine sets per-switch status fields and clears `switch_reprovisioning_requested` when the cycle completes. |
| **Error** | Switch is in error (for example firmware upgrade failed, certificate job failed, or NVOS MAC conflict). Can transition to `Deleting` or `Maintenance`; otherwise waits for manual intervention. |
| **Deleting** | Switch is being removed; ends in final delete (terminal). |

## Transitions (by trigger)

| From | To | Trigger / Condition |
|------|-----|----------------------|
| *(create)* | Created | Switch created |
| Created | Initializing (`WaitForOsMachineInterface`) | Controller processes switch |
| Initializing (`WaitForOsMachineInterface`) | Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `Start`) | All NVOS interfaces associated for expected switch |
| Initializing (`WaitForOsMachineInterface`) | Error | Expected switch has empty `nvos_mac_addresses` or MAC owned by another switch |
| Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `Start`) | Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Component manager returns RMS job ID (`domain_name` = `rack_id`) |
| Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `Start`) | Configuring (`RotateOsPassword`) | No `rack_id` or no component manager (skip certificate step) |
| Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Configuring (`RotateOsPassword`) | RMS job `Completed` |
| Configuring (`ConfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Error | RMS job `Failed` |
| Configuring (`RotateOsPassword`) | FetchInfo | NVOS credentials stored or already in Vault |
| Configuring (`RotateOsPassword`) | Error | No expected switch or missing BMC MAC |
| FetchInfo | Validating (`ValidationComplete`) | Slot/tray lookup attempted (always advances) |
| Validating (`ValidationComplete`) | BomValidating (`BomValidationComplete`) | Validation complete |
| BomValidating (`BomValidationComplete`) | Ready | BOM validation complete |
| Ready | Deleting | `deleted` set (marked for deletion) |
| Ready | Maintenance | `switch_maintenance_requested` is set |
| Ready | ReProvisioning (`WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`) | `switch_reprovisioning_requested` with `initiator` prefixed `rack-` |
| Ready | Error | Unknown `switch_reprovisioning_requested` initiator |
| Maintenance (`PowerOn` / `PowerOff` / `Reset`) | Ready | BMC operation complete; maintenance request cleared |
| Maintenance (`PowerOn` / `PowerOff` / `Reset`) | Error | BMC operation failed |
| Maintenance (`ReconfigureCertificate` `Start`) | Maintenance (`ReconfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Component manager returns RMS job ID |
| Maintenance (`ReconfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Ready | RMS job `Completed`; maintenance request cleared |
| Maintenance (`ReconfigureCertificate` `WaitForComplete`) | Error | RMS job `Failed` |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`) | ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNVOSUpgrade`) | `firmware_upgrade_status` terminal `Completed` and `continue_after_firmware_upgrade` is true |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`) | Ready | `firmware_upgrade_status` terminal `Completed` and `continue_after_firmware_upgrade` is false |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade`) | Error | `firmware_upgrade_status` terminal `Failed` |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNVOSUpgrade`) | ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNMXCConfigure`) | `nvos_update_status` terminal `Completed` |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNVOSUpgrade`) | Error | `nvos_update_status` terminal `Failed` |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNMXCConfigure`) | Ready | `fabric_manager_status` reports running |
| ReProvisioning (`WaitingForNMXCConfigure`) | Error | `fabric_manager_status` reports an error message |
| ReProvisioning (any sub-state) | Ready | Parent rack entered `Error`; rack-level reprovision request cleared |
| Error | Deleting | `deleted` set (marked for deletion) |
| Error | Maintenance | `switch_maintenance_requested` is set |
| Deleting | *(end)* | Final delete committed |

## Rack-Level Re-Provisioning

Rack maintenance drives switch reprovisioning by setting `switch_reprovisioning_requested` with an initiator prefixed `rack-`. The switch controller then walks these sub-states in order when `continue_after_firmware_upgrade` is true (the default):

```text
WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade -> WaitingForNVOSUpgrade -> WaitingForNMXCConfigure -> Ready
```

The rack state machine updates per-switch `firmware_upgrade_status`, `nvos_update_status`, and `fabric_manager_status` while the switch waits in each sub-state. If the parent rack enters `Error`, the switch aborts reprovisioning and returns to `Ready`.

## On-Demand Maintenance Operations

The `Maintenance` state is entered when `switch_maintenance_requested` is posted (from `Ready` or `Error`). Supported operations:

- **PowerOn** — powers the switch on via the component manager.
- **PowerOff** — powers the switch off.
- **Reset** — force-restarts the switch.
- **ReconfigureCertificate** — reinstalls or rotates NVOS mTLS certificates via component manager / RMS. Uses the same async certificate flow as bring-up; see [Switch Certificate Configuration](switch_configure_certificate.md).

## Implementation

- **State type**: `SwitchControllerState` in `crates/api-model/src/switch/mod.rs`.
- **Handlers**: `crates/switch-controller/src/` — one module per top-level state (`created`, `initializing`, `configuring`, `fetch_info`, `validating`, `bom_validating`, `ready`, `maintenance`, `reprovisioning`, `error_state`, `deleting`).
- **Certificate configuration design**: [switch_configure_certificate.md](switch_configure_certificate.md).
- **Orchestration**: `SwitchStateHandler` in `handler.rs` delegates to the handler for the current `controller_state`.
