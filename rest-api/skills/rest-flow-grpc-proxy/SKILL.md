# REST Flow gRPC Proxy Skill

Use this guidance when building or converting `infra-controller` REST API
endpoints that need to call on-site Flow through the generic Flow gRPC proxy.

## Current Proxy Contract

- Cloud helper: `rest-api/api/pkg/api/handler/util/common/grpcproxy.go`,
  `ExecuteFlowGRPC`.
- Shared contract: `rest-api/common/pkg/grpcproxy/grpcproxy.go`, with
  `grpcproxy.Request` and `grpcproxy.Response`. Flow and Core share every layer
  of the proxy; the backend is named by `grpcproxy.Flow`, and each layer keeps a
  per-backend wrapper only because Temporal dispatches on the registered
  workflow and activity names.
- Site workflow/activity: `InvokeFlowGRPC` and `InvokeFlowGRPCOnSite`.
- Site Flow invocation: `FlowGrpcClient.InvokeJSON`.
- Temporal transport payload: protojson, so non-secret request fields and
  responses remain readable in Temporal UI.
- Secret transport payload: selected top-level protojson fields are redacted
  from `RequestJSON` and carried separately in `EncryptedSecrets`.
  `grpcproxy.RedactSecrets` / `grpcproxy.MergeSecrets` do the splitting and are
  shared with the Core proxy.
- Final site-to-Flow call: normal binary gRPC. The JSON step is only the
  generic Temporal payload representation.

## Critical Difference From CoreProxy

`ExecuteCoreGRPC` always generates a fresh workflow ID
(`core-grpc-{Method}-{uuid}`) and does not set `USE_EXISTING`.

`ExecuteFlowGRPC` requires the caller to supply:

1. `workflowID` — deterministic for read/list dedup, fresh UUID for creates.
2. `conflictPolicy` — the two travel together. A deterministic ID takes
   `WORKFLOW_ID_CONFLICT_POLICY_USE_EXISTING` so identical in-flight requests
   coalesce onto one Flow call; a fresh ID takes
   `WORKFLOW_ID_CONFLICT_POLICY_UNSPECIFIED`, matching `ExecuteCoreGRPC`, whose
   IDs are always fresh.

Two helpers in `common` carry this for every migrated handler:
`common.FlowWorkflowID` applies the transport namespace, and
`common.ProxyFlowGRPC` dispatches and renders the failure as an Echo response.
Use `ExecuteFlowGRPC` directly only in helpers that hand the error back to a
caller instead of rendering a response, as `resolveTrayIDsBySlot` does; return
the `*cutil.APIError` unwrapped so the status the proxy chose survives.

Kinds of ID derivation that must stay in the handler, using the TaskRun
endpoints as the worked example:

- A read whose response shape depends on a query flag must encode that flag, so
  `GetTaskRun` needs `includeStats` in the ID
  (`flow-grpc-task-run-get-{runID}-{true|false}`). Attaching to an execution
  started with the other value would return stats presence that contradicts the
  request.
- A list must hash its query parameters (`QueryParamHash`) into the ID, so two
  different filters never coalesce.
- A create must never coalesce at all, so `CreateTaskRun` uses a fresh UUID
  (`flow-grpc-task-run-create-{uuid}`) and `USE_EXISTING` can never match.

Prefix deterministic IDs with the transport (`flow-grpc-`). A deterministic ID
plus `USE_EXISTING` attaches to whatever execution already holds that name, so
an ID shared with a different workflow type — a bespoke predecessor still
running during a rollout, for instance — yields a result payload this proxy
cannot decode.

## Timeout Ladder

The ladder is bounded from the outside, not chosen from the on-site budget:
`server.WriteTimeout` is a deadline on the response write, so a handler that
answers later than that cannot deliver its answer. Keep
`ActivityStartToCloseTimeout` < `grpcproxy.WorkflowExecutionTimeout` <
`cutil.WorkflowContextTimeout` < `server.WriteTimeout`, currently
40s < 45s < 50s < 60s. `Test_ProxyTimeoutsFitWriteTimeout` in
`api/internal/server` guards the outer bound. Raising the on-site budget means
raising the server and load-balancer timeouts first.

Because the workflow timeout sits inside the caller's context timeout, a timeout
that Temporal itself reports comes from an execution that has closed. The ladder
does not cover the other way a caller loses its result: `wfCtx` derives from the
request context, so a client disconnect or a shorter upstream deadline can end
the wait while the execution runs on. `wfCtx.Err()` is the only evidence that
this happened, which is why a `context.DeadlineExceeded` in the workflow result
alone does not classify as it — it can come from inside the execution.

## Before Coding

Confirm these details before editing:

- REST operation path, method, auth role, org/site scoping, Flow enablement
  check, request model, response model, and expected status code.
- Target Flow method, usually `/v1.Flow/<Method>`, and whether it is unary.
  The proxy does not support streaming methods.
- Typed protobuf request and optional typed protobuf response.
- Workflow ID derivation and conflict policy for this call.
- Secret fields that must not appear in Temporal history (top-level protojson
  field names).
- Whether the call fits in the proxy's budget. The activity is cut off at
  `grpcproxy.ActivityStartToCloseTimeout`, currently 40s. The bespoke workflows
  declared 2 minutes, and bring-up and firmware 5 minutes, but every Flow caller
  bounded itself with the 50s `cutil.WorkflowContextTimeout`, so no declared
  budget was reachable. Migrating still narrows the window: a Flow call that took
  41-49s used to succeed and now fails.
- Whether the call tolerates losing an activity retry. `InvokeFlowGRPC` runs the
  activity with `MaximumAttempts: 1`, so a transient Flow error surfaces to the
  client instead of being retried. Bespoke workflows that allowed a second
  attempt lose it on migration, and the retry policy lives in the site workflow,
  so making it configurable takes another agent release to take effect.

## Implementation Workflow

1. Keep auth, tenant/org membership, site lookup, Flow enablement, role checks,
   request validation, and REST semantics in the REST handler.
2. Build the typed Flow protobuf request before calling the proxy.
3. Call `common.ExecuteFlowGRPC(ctx, siteTemporalClient, fullMethod, reqProto,
   respProtoOrNil, workflowID, conflictPolicy, siteIDSecretKey, secretFields...)`.
   Passing `secretFields` requires a non-empty `siteIDSecretKey`; the helper
   rejects the combination rather than send the fields unredacted.
4. Return `StatusGatewayTimeout` as it comes. Do not call
   `TerminateWorkflowOnTimeOut`. When Temporal reports the timeout the execution
   has already closed, and terminating a closed execution fails and reports a
   data desync that did not happen. When the caller stopped waiting instead, the
   execution may still be running, and terminating it still does not help: the
   activity does not heartbeat, so Temporal cannot deliver cancellation while
   its Flow RPC is in progress, and terminating only the workflow discards the
   result without stopping that RPC. For a deterministic ID with `USE_EXISTING`
   it also frees the ID, so a retried request starts a duplicate mutation
   instead of attaching to the call already in flight. An abandoned execution
   stays bounded by the 45s and 40s timeouts.
5. Return a curated REST response. Do not expose Flow protobufs or secret
   fields directly unless the API contract already does.
6. For a new public REST endpoint, register the route and update OpenAPI. For a
   migration from a bespoke workflow to the generic proxy, keep the REST
   contract and the parameter-derivation rules for the workflow ID unchanged,
   but namespace the resulting ID by transport as described above. The derived
   ID string itself must change, otherwise the proxy and the workflow it
   replaces can attach to each other.

## Rollout Requirement

A workflow type is known only to the workers that registered it. The cloud API
and each site's agent ship as separate Helm releases (`nico-rest` and
`nico-rest-site-agent`) and cannot be upgraded atomically, and Temporal accepts
a submission for a type no worker knows: the execution is created, no worker can
advance it, and the caller sees only a timeout after
`grpcproxy.WorkflowExecutionTimeout`.

So a handler may not start dispatching through `InvokeFlowGRPC` in the same
release that first registers it on the site agent. Register the proxy first,
wait for every site to run that agent, and switch handlers in a later release.
Retire the workflow a migration replaces in a third release, once no supported
cloud release still submits it.

When adding a Flow endpoint, reach for the proxy: there is no longer a bespoke
Flow workflow to copy, and adding one would reintroduce the per-method
registration this replaced.
